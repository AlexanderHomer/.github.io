## 
Head &
Neck Surgery -- Clinic Guide


### 
Dr. O'Leary's Clinic



- 

Correct the chief compliant. Put type/site of cancer TNM stage
and treatment (with date) at the beginning of every note (T2N1M0 HPV+
left base of tongue SCCa s/p concomitant chemoradiation with weekly
cisplatin completed on 10/13/2018.)



- 

Use Dr O'Leary's New patient or Follow up visit
templates



- 

ALWAYS CC op-note to primary care physician, other care providers
(rad onc, med onc) and referring physician'



- 

Spray the patients with Lidocaine/Afrin spray prior to presenting
to Dr. O'Leary so there is enough time for local anesthesia and
decongestion




### 
Dr. Wein's Clinic




- 
if you can, dictate your notes and minimize the amount of templating

- 
always give patients a copy of their pathology, lab, or imaging results at the time of an office visit

- 
document and circle the appropriate spaces on the encounter form if:

- 
smoking cessation advised

- 
imaging/labs ordered or surgery booked

- 
imaging/labs/path reviewed

- 
procedures performed



- 
Always CC the corresponding MD at the end of the note with "CC: Andrew Scott, MD", and not with less formal approaches like "Dr. Scott, PCP"



### 
Dr. Tracy's Clinic



- 
Similar to Dr. O'Leary's clinic flow


### 
Burning Mouth Consults



*Dr. O'Leary's workup*



- 
Obtain lab tests: ANA, SS-A, SS-B, TSH, fasting glucose, A1c, CBC w/ diff, ferritin, Vit B1, B2, B6, B12, folate, Mg2+, Zinc

- 
Biopsy if visible lesion

- 
Consider patch testing


### 
Aphthous ulcer
treatments



triamcinolone acetonide with carboxymethylcellulose paste (Kenalog in
Orabase)



Fluocinonide (Lidex) gel



Peridex mouthwash



Aphthasol paste -- Aphthasol oral paste is usually applied 4 times
each day--usually after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at
bedtime.



Oral B12 melts (made by same company as Xylimelts)


### 
Inspire Consults



- 

Check diagnosis of sleep apnea: AHI, (must be btw 15-65 w/
\21yo. BMI\1cm seen on PET scans that are confirmed on thyroid
U/S should get an FNA 





- 

Initial workup of palpable or incidentally found nodules 



- 

**TSH **\[Free T_4_\]
and **Ultrasound ** 



- 

**Normal or high TSH** → no need for reuptake
radionuclide cscan 



- 

**Low** TSH → get a Iodine^123^ or
Technetium^99^ reuptake scan 



- 

"Hot Nodule" → evaluate for hyperthyroidism 



- 

"Cold Nodules" have a 5% risk of cancer and should get an
ultrasound 



- 

Multiple nodules? Evaluate each one separately. 



- 

If TSH low or normal. Get I^123^ scan to see if there
are autonomous nodules  



- 

FNA iso or nonfunctioning nodules. 



- 

FNA 



- 

Don't bother if its completely cystic 



- 

Perform FNA if nodule is (A) \>2cm ** or **(B) 
\>1cm + suspicious features 



- 

Suspicious Ultrasound features (70% chance of malignancy) 



- 

**Hypo**echoic - think hypOH DEAR ITS
CANCER 



- 

partially cystic and iso/hyperechoic are less worrying features:
perform FNA if \>1.5cm 





- 

Microcalcification or rim calcifications 



- 

Increased central vascularity 



- 

Tall than wide (think a Cachetic patient) = bad. Wider than tall
(fat person) = good 



- 

Irregular margins 




#### 
Bethesda system -
Interpreting Results



- 

Malignant (99% risk) & suspicious for malignancy (70%
risk) 



- 

Go to Surgery   



- 

Indeterminate cytology - Two types 



- 

Follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm or
Hurthle Cell (25% risk of malignancy) 



- 

Pretty much all of these are surgically excised. Affirma to
supplement decision making 



- 

FLUS (follicular lesion of unknown significance) or Atypia of
undetermined significance --- 14% risk 



- 

Can observe or excise.  Affirma test can help you rule out
malignancy 



- 

Surgery: if excision is planned - do a lobectomy unless there are
reasons in the history that make us more suspicious for
malignancy  



- 

Nondiagnostic---(around 1-4% risk):  



- 

repeat U/S guided FNA. Most people wait \~3months but should
repeat sooner if there are concerning U/S findings 



- 

Can excise if suspicious u/s findings or if its growth \>20% in
2 directions 



- 

Benign --- 2.5% risk 



- 

Follow up these patients 



- 

Suspicious U/S features: repeat U/S & FNA within 12
months 



- 

Otherwise repeat U/S in 12-24months and FNA if (a) growth \>20%
in 2 directions or (b) nodule develops suspicious features 



- 

You can stop following any nodule that's had two benign cytology
results. Its benign, get over it 





- 

Follow Up 



- 

Nodules that met criteria for FNA but were benign: see
above 



- 

Nodules that did not meet criteria for FNA 



- 

repeat U/S in 12-24months (you don't need to follow spongiform or
purely cyst nodules) 



- 

Nodules that are \>4cm or cause compressive symptoms can be
surgically removed 



- 

Preoperative: Guidelines recommend documentation of voice and
performing a FOE prior to Thyroid surgery on EVERY patient. Discuss risk
of thyroid surgery to voice. Discuss findings of FOE w/
anesthesia.



- 

Perioperative: should identify RLN and SLN. Intraop nerve
monitoring is optional. No opinion on decadron



- 

Postop: should perform FOE on patients w/ voice change post op.
If abnormal voice or VF mobility abnormality, patients should f/u with
SLP

Voice Outcomes after Thyroid Surgery -- Clinical Practice Guideline

### 
Adult Neck Mass --
Clinical Practice Guideline



- 

Don't routinely give antibiotics unless other signs of infection
exist



- 

Suspicious if: present for \>2 weeks w/o change in size
or if on exam mass is (1) fixed to adjacent structure (2) firm
(3) \>1.5cm or (4) has ulceration of overlying skin or history
highly suspicious



- 

In these patients, do targeted physical exam (FOE etc)



- 

Strongly recommend CT neck (U/S or MRI ok) or performing an FNA
on these suspicious neck masses



- 

FNA should be done INSTEAD of an open biopsy



- 

Cystic masses: don't assume that they are benign



- 

If testing is negative:



- 

Can either with open biopsy (should always be done with a
direct laryngoscopy)



- 

Or could do additional testing (CBC, ANA, SSA/SSB, ESR, TSH, PTH,
EBV,CMV, PPD, Bartonella, Thyroid U/S, CT chest /w contrast,
Thyroglobulin FNA-needle wash assay




### 
Nerve Sheath Tumors


#### 
Paragangliomas
(Glomus tumors)



Glomus Jugulare: supplied by ascending pharyngeal a.



Glomus Tympanicum: arise from Jacobson's nerve (CNIX)



Carotid Body: MC in H&N: internal carotid posterior and external
carotid anteriorly (Lyre sign)



Vagal paraganglioma: Displaces carotid anteriorly and medially


### 
Salivary Glands



Innervation:



- 
Sup. Salivary nuc → GSPN (pregang. parasymp.) \[CN7\] → pterygopalatine ganglion → lacrimal

- 
Inf. Salivary nuc → Lesser petrosal \[CN9\] → Otic ganglion → auriculotemporal n. → parotid

- 
Sup. Salivary nuc → Corda Tympani \[CN7\] → Submandibular ganglion → submandibular gland


### 
Melanoma



- 

Ask about:



- 

Sunlight exposure, history of skin burns, family history
(xeroderma pigmentosum, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma
syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome)



- 

Presents as a mole-like growth with "ABCD" (ABCD is diagnostic
not prognostic )



- 

Asymmetry, Borders are irregular. Color is not uniform. Diameter
\> 6 mm.



- 

Workup:



- 

Ideally: excisional biopsy w/ 1-2mm narrow margins. If too large,
can do punch biopsy however this is subject to sampling error so if
negative, strongly consider repeating. This will give you information to
perform the wide local excision later.



- 

Patients with:



- 

Stage IB or higher: should get a CXR (r/o lung mets) LDH (eval
for liver mets)



- 

Palpable LNs or imaging findings for enlarged LNs: get U/S guided
FNA to eval for metastatic LN disease



- 

Stage III disease: some advocate for CT C/A/P to look for distant
mets (CT chest is most important)



- 

Stage IV disease: PET-CT C/A/P, MRI head, refer for clinical
trials



- 

Prognosis depends on variant: worse with ↑Breslow Depth,
ulceration, M\>F, and Head/Neck location



- 

Occiput and cheek most common sites of H&N



- 

Markers



- 

HMB-45 (specific). S-100 sensitive. Melan A. MART-1



- 

Variants include



- 

Superficial spreading---most common subtype; dominant early radial
growth results in good prognosis.



- 

Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM)---lentiginous proliferation (radial
growth); best prognosis. Associated with sun-exposed skin and the
elderly



- 

Nodular---blue/blackish, looks like hemangiomaearly vertical
growth; poor prognosis



- 

Acral lentiginous---arises on the palms or soles, often in
dark-skinned individuals; not related to UV light exposure



- 

Desmoplastic-Neurotropic Melanoma (DM): often are amelanotic.
High rate of recurrence



- 

Clark levels: only useful for prognosis in T1 lesions.



- 

**epidermis** only = stage I.



- 

**Into papillary** dermis = II.



- 

**All of papillary** dermis =III.



- 

Invades **reticular** dermis = IV.



- 

Into **subcutaneous** tissue: V

Tis = 0.5mm margin



T1 (\2mm): do 2cm




- 

T2/T3/T4



- 

Adjuvant: may consider interferon alpha 2b (Stage III+)



- 

N0 neck: consider sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB). Especially if



- 

\15-25%, should do neck dissection



**N0 disease in:**



- 

Oral Cavity - I - III



- 

Oropharynx - II - IV



- 

Hypopharynx/Larynx - II-IV, VI when appropriate



- 

Subglottic - II-IV and VI




### 
Oral Cavity CA



**Management**



- 

Excision w/ reconstruction. Tumors \60

- 
Avoid pressors as much as possible, please give fluid boluses or transfuse with RBC if hypotensive



**RESP:**



- 
7.0 Shiley proximal XLT trach in place with 4-point sutures, and superior and inferior stay sutures

- 
In the event of decannulation, pull the stay sutures towards the skin to bring the trachea more superficial and replace the tracheostomy tube. Patient is also intubatable from above



**GI:**



- 
Advance tube feeds to continuous rate (impact peptide)

- 
OK for meds via DHT

- 
Continue bowel regimen

- 
Continue daily electrolyte checks, replete as necessary

- 
STRICT NPO. No swabs or ice chips.



**ID:**



- 
Daily CBC

- 
S/p unasyn through 8/10

- 
Peridex TID

- 
Bacitracin to incisions BID



**GU:**



- 
Continue to monitor strict I/Os

- 
Remove foley when able



**HEME:**



- 
Start prophylactic dose lovenox 40 mg QD

- 
CBC daily



**MSK:**



- 
Continue to monitor leg for compartment syndrome

- 
Obtain right leg orthotic

- 
Wound vac in place for 5 days

- 
Work with PT daily, OOB

- 
PT/OT consult


### 
Laryngectomy



- 

Diet: NPO



- 

Nursing:



- 

humidified air at all times (unless HME in place)



- 

keep laryngectomy tube in place, clean once daily



- 

suction laryngectomy stoma as needed for secretions



- 

apply bacitracin ointment to chest and neck twice daily



- 

sign above bed saying patient cannot be intubated from
above



- 

Leave trach collar loose fitting ( 2 fingerbreadths distance from
neck)



- 

If stoma vent is dislodged, it is NOT an airway emergency; gently
place back into stoma



- 

Rounds: **check for crusting in the stoma** --
any exposed cartilage? In radiated patients, look out for possible
fistula formation (tube feeds coming out neck)




### 
Thyroidectomy



- 

Check PTH and iCa2+ post-op in PACU. If PTH abnormal, check iCa2+
q4-6hours. If normal, recheck iCa2+ q8hrs.



- 

levothyroxine: according to endocrine, **levothyroxine dose
in mcg = 1.7xpt's weight (kg)**



- 

If hypocalcemic -- replete Ca2+ (see electrolyte section)




### 
Tracheostomy
Tube Placement



- 

Post op CXR



- 

As RT to get a spare trach (plus size smaller) in the room. Make
sure fresh inner cannulas, trach ties are in the room



- 

Make sure nursing has suctioning set-up



- 

Order routine trach care (suctioning PRN, humidified
air)





First trach change:



- 

Done on POD5-7. Longer if you expect trach change to be
difficult: deep neck, high lung compliance (aka high PEEP
requirement).



- 

**Before trach change**: ask RT to put new trachs at
bedside and ask the RN to verify the correct type is there. Also ask the
RN to give some pain medication just before change.



- 

**Need**: shoulder roll, headlight, new trach, 10cc
syringe, lube, suture scissors, suction set up in room, flexible
'chimney' suction, yankeur suction, 4x4 gauze w/ saline, Velcro trach
tie, allvyn dressing (prn)



- 

After 1^st^ trach change: RT can change the
trach




### 
Specific Complications and their management


#### 
Chyle Leak:



If suspected, collect from JP and send for triglycerides,
chylomicrons. Also get serum triglycerides. Positive if TG \>100mg/dL
if TG(in JP) \> TG serum or if there are any chylomicrons



Low output: \500cc/day: typically need to go to OR.
