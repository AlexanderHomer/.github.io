## Rules of the Game


The goal of residency is avoiding **phone calls** and avoiding **pages**


**Build your differential**: mistakes happen when you prematurely close on a diagnosis. R/O the worst-case scenarios


**Never make assumptions.**


If you **delegate work,** you are still responsible for following up on the result


**Escalate** any clinical changes in a patient to a senior resident or attending. This is not just to CYA but to avoid mistakes. Two eyes are better than one


**Text out** to the other residents for any consults, new ED or post-op admissions.


**Everyone’s time is valuable**. No matter what level of training you are, no job is above or beneath you. Don’t ask others to do your busy work. No-one is going to clean up your mess.


**Help the PGY-2**. It’s a small service so if anyone isn’t pulling their weight things fall apart.  We are our own checks and balances.


**Teach**– you have an obligation to pass on your knowledge to the residents, interns, and medical students under you. If you present, make sure you give people 3-4 take away points.


**Be prepared for every case** – pretend there is no attending with you.


When you present to an attending, give **just the meat** – tell them what symptoms the patient has before telling them what the patient doesn’t have\*\*.\*\*


**Don’t miss didactics.** The service as a team must protect this time.


**Temporal bones don’t drill themselves** – but they want to be drilled. Keep the temporal bone lab in good working order and harvest bones in the Spring


**Treat every day like a job interview** – The attendings notice when you work hard and when you slack off. Ultimately, their opinion of you dictates your ability to get a job/match into a fellowship after residency.


**Update the guide**: every time you think “this would be useful for the pocketbook,” add it in. This doesn’t update itself.


Try and **improve every aspect of our program**. Everyone has to do their bit to leave this program better off than when you came.
