## Head & Neck Surgery -- Clinic Guide

### Dr. O'Leary's Clinic

1.  Correct the chief compliant. Put type/site of cancer TNM stage
    and treatment (with date) at the beginning of every note (T2N1M0 HPV+
    left base of tongue SCCa s/p concomitant chemoradiation with weekly
    cisplatin completed on 10/13/2018.)

2.  Use Dr O'Leary's New patient or Follow up visit
    templates

3.  ALWAYS CC op-note to primary care physician, other care providers
    (rad onc, med onc) and referring physician'

4.  Spray the patients with Lidocaine/Afrin spray prior to presenting
    to Dr. O'Leary so there is enough time for local anesthesia and
    decongestion

### Dr. Wein's Clinic

1.  if you can, dictate your notes and minimize the amount of templating
2.  always give patients a copy of their pathology, lab, or imaging results at the time of an office visit
3.  document and circle the appropriate spaces on the encounter form if:
    - smoking cessation advised
    - imaging/labs ordered or surgery booked
    - imaging/labs/path reviewed
    - procedures performed
4.  Always CC the corresponding MD at the end of the note with "CC: Andrew Scott, MD", and not with less formal approaches like "Dr. Scott, PCP"

### Dr. Tracy's Clinic

1.  Similar to Dr. O'Leary's clinic flow

### Burning Mouth Consults

*Dr. O'Leary's workup*

- Obtain lab tests: ANA, SS-A, SS-B, TSH, fasting glucose, A1c, CBC w/ diff, ferritin, Vit B1, B2, B6, B12, folate, Mg2+, Zinc
- Biopsy if visible lesion
- Consider patch testing

### Aphthous ulcer treatments

triamcinolone acetonide with carboxymethylcellulose paste (Kenalog in
Orabase)

Fluocinonide (Lidex) gel

Peridex mouthwash

Aphthasol paste -- Aphthasol oral paste is usually applied 4 times
each day--usually after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at
bedtime.

Oral B12 melts (made by same company as Xylimelts)

### Inspire Consults

- Check diagnosis of sleep apnea: AHI, (must be btw 15-65 w/
  25% central apneas) date of sleep study (should be in last 3 years).
  Ask previous nasal, palate, tonsil surgeries. Still having daytime
  fatigue. Check social hx: work history/driving problems. Ask about heart
  failure/afib

- Patients must be 21yo. BMI32

- Check CPAP usage: 4 hours/5days tolerated and reasons for
  poor tolerance (claustrophobia etc).

- Contraindications: Pts w/ neuromuscular disorders or those who
  can't operate the remote at night. Pregnant pts. Pts w/ complete
  concentric collapse of the soft palate of sleep endoscopy

### Thyroid Nodules

- Nodules incidentally found on imaging 

  1.  Should always be confirmed by Thyroid & Cervical
      U/S 

  2.  Nodules 1cm seen on PET scans that are confirmed on thyroid
      U/S should get an FNA 

- Initial workup of palpable or incidentally found nodules 

  - **TSH **Free T4
    and **Ultrasound ** 

  - **Normal or high TSH** → no need for reuptake
    radionuclide cscan 

  - **Low** TSH → get a Iodine123 or
    Technetium99 reuptake scan 

    1.  "Hot Nodule" → evaluate for hyperthyroidism 

    2.  "Cold Nodules" have a 5% risk of cancer and should get an
        ultrasound 

    3.  Multiple nodules? Evaluate each one separately. 

        - If TSH low or normal. Get I123 scan to see if there
          are autonomous nodules  

        - FNA iso or nonfunctioning nodules. 

        - FNA 

          - Don't bother if its completely cystic 

          - Perform FNA if nodule is (A) 2cm ** or **(B) 
            1cm + suspicious features 

          - Suspicious Ultrasound features (70% chance of malignancy) 

            - **Hypo**echoic - think hypOH DEAR ITS
              CANCER 

              - partially cystic and iso/hyperechoic are less worrying features:
                perform FNA if 1.5cm 

            - Microcalcification or rim calcifications 

            - Increased central vascularity 

            - Tall than wide (think a Cachetic patient) = bad. Wider than tall
              (fat person) = good 

            - Irregular margins 

            #### Bethesda system - Interpreting Results

            4.  Malignant (99% risk) & suspicious for malignancy (70%
                risk) 

                - Go to Surgery   

                - Indeterminate cytology - Two types 

                  - Follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm or
                    Hurthle Cell (25% risk of malignancy) 

                    - Pretty much all of these are surgically excised. Affirma to
                      supplement decision making 

                    - FLUS (follicular lesion of unknown significance) or Atypia of
                      undetermined significance --- 14% risk 

                      - Can observe or excise.  Affirma test can help you rule out
                        malignancy 

                      - Surgery: if excision is planned - do a lobectomy unless there are
                        reasons in the history that make us more suspicious for
                        malignancy  

                      - Nondiagnostic---(around 1-4% risk):  

                        - repeat U/S guided FNA. Most people wait 3months but should
                          repeat sooner if there are concerning U/S findings 

                        - Can excise if suspicious u/s findings or if its growth 20% in
                          2 directions 

                        - Benign --- 2.5% risk 

                          - Follow up these patients 

                            - Suspicious U/S features: repeat U/S & FNA within 12
                              months 

                            - Otherwise repeat U/S in 12-24months and FNA if (a) growth 20%
                              in 2 directions or (b) nodule develops suspicious features 

                            - You can stop following any nodule that's had two benign cytology
                              results. Its benign, get over it 

                            5.  Follow Up 

                                - Nodules that met criteria for FNA but were benign: see
                                  above 

                                - Nodules that did not meet criteria for FNA 

                                - repeat U/S in 12-24months (you don't need to follow spongiform or
                                  purely cyst nodules) 

                                - Nodules that are 4cm or cause compressive symptoms can be
                                  surgically removed 

                                - Preoperative: Guidelines recommend documentation of voice and
                                  performing a FOE prior to Thyroid surgery on EVERY patient. Discuss risk
                                  of thyroid surgery to voice. Discuss findings of FOE w/
                                  anesthesia.

                                - Perioperative: should identify RLN and SLN. Intraop nerve
                                  monitoring is optional. No opinion on decadron

                                - Postop: should perform FOE on patients w/ voice change post op.
                                  If abnormal voice or VF mobility abnormality, patients should f/u with
                                  SLP

### Improving Voice Outcomes after Thyroid Surgery -- Clinical Practice Guideline

### Adult Neck Mass -- Clinical Practice Guideline

- Don't routinely give antibiotics unless other signs of infection
exist

- Suspicious if: present for 2 weeks w/o change in size
or if on exam mass is (1) fixed to adjacent structure (2) firm
(3) 1.5cm or (4) has ulceration of overlying skin or history
highly suspicious

- In these patients, do targeted physical exam (FOE etc)

- Strongly recommend CT neck (U/S or MRI ok) or performing an FNA
on these suspicious neck masses

- FNA should be done INSTEAD of an open biopsy

- Cystic masses: don't assume that they are benign

- If testing is negative:

- Can either with open biopsy (should always be done with a
direct laryngoscopy)

- Or could do additional testing (CBC, ANA, SSA/SSB, ESR, TSH, PTH,
EBV,CMV, PPD, Bartonella, Thyroid U/S, CT chest /w contrast,
Thyroglobulin FNA-needle wash assay

### Nerve Sheath Tumors

#### Paragangliomas (Glomus tumors)

Glomus Jugulare: supplied by ascending pharyngeal a.

Glomus Tympanicum: arise from Jacobson's nerve (CNIX)

Carotid Body: MC in H&N: internal carotid posterior and external
carotid anteriorly (Lyre sign)

Vagal paraganglioma: Displaces carotid anteriorly and medially

### Salivary Glands

Innervation:

- Sup. Salivary nuc → GSPN (pregang. parasymp.) CN7 → pterygopalatine ganglion → lacrimal
- Inf. Salivary nuc → Lesser petrosal CN9 → Otic ganglion → auriculotemporal n. → parotid
- Sup. Salivary nuc → Corda Tympani CN7 → Submandibular ganglion → submandibular gland

### Melanoma

                                      - Ask about:

                                        - Sunlight exposure, history of skin burns, family history
                                          (xeroderma pigmentosum, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma
                                          syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome)

                                        - Presents as a mole-like growth with "ABCD" (ABCD is diagnostic
                                          not prognostic )

                                          - Asymmetry, Borders are irregular. Color is not uniform. Diameter
                                             6 mm.

                                          - Workup:

                                            - Ideally: excisional biopsy w/ 1-2mm narrow margins. If too large,
                                              can do punch biopsy however this is subject to sampling error so if
                                              negative, strongly consider repeating. This will give you information to
                                              perform the wide local excision later.

                                            - Patients with:

                                            - Stage IB or higher: should get a CXR (r/o lung mets) LDH (eval
                                              for liver mets)

                                            - Palpable LNs or imaging findings for enlarged LNs: get U/S guided
                                              FNA to eval for metastatic LN disease

                                            - Stage III disease: some advocate for CT C/A/P to look for distant
                                              mets (CT chest is most important)

                                            - Stage IV disease: PET-CT C/A/P, MRI head, refer for clinical
                                              trials

                                            - Prognosis depends on variant: worse with ↑Breslow Depth,
                                              ulceration, MF, and Head/Neck location

                                              - Occiput and cheek most common sites of H&N

                                              - Markers

                                                - HMB-45 (specific). S-100 sensitive. Melan A. MART-1

                                                - Variants include

                                                  - Superficial spreading---most common subtype; dominant early radial
                                                    growth results in good prognosis.

                                                  - Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM)---lentiginous proliferation (radial
                                                    growth); best prognosis. Associated with sun-exposed skin and the
                                                    elderly

                                                  - Nodular---blue/blackish, looks like hemangiomaearly vertical
                                                    growth; poor prognosis

                                                  - Acral lentiginous---arises on the palms or soles, often in
                                                    dark-skinned individuals; not related to UV light exposure

                                                  - Desmoplastic-Neurotropic Melanoma (DM): often are amelanotic.
                                                    High rate of recurrence

                                                  - Clark levels: only useful for prognosis in T1 lesions.

                                                          - Adjuvant: may consider interferon alpha 2b (Stage III+)

                                                          - N0 neck: consider sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB). Especially if

                                                              - Superficial parotidectomy + MRND if primary location is:
                                                                anterior/lateral scalp, temple, lateral forehead, lateral cheek , ear
                                                                (basically anything anterior to the plane of the EACs)
