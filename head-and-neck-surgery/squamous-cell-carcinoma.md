## 
Head &
Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma


#### 
Prognosis by Stage



Stage 0 ---99%



Stage 1 --- 90-92%



Stage 2 --- 75-85%



Stage 3 --- 50%



Stage 4 --- 25-35%


#### 
Who gets
chemotherapy



- 

Nasopharyngeal CA: Stage III-IV, some Stage II



- 

Unresectable H&N Ca



- 

Laryngeal CA: induction cisplatin/5-FU for organ
preservation



- 

Unknown Primary -- patients with N2,N3 disease



- 

**Patients with positive margins or lymph nodes that have
ECS**




#### 
Who gets
radiation therapy to neck



- 

Patients with N1 disease + extracapsular spread



- 

Patients with N2-3 disease




#### 
Who gets a neck
dissection:



Classic training is that if risk of spread to lymph nodes is
\>15-25%, should do neck dissection



**N0 disease in:**



- 

Oral Cavity - I - III



- 

Oropharynx - II - IV



- 

Hypopharynx/Larynx - II-IV, VI when appropriate



- 

Subglottic - II-IV and VI




### 
Oral Cavity CA



**Management**



- 

Excision w/ reconstruction. Tumors \<2cm can be approached
transorally



- 

Mandible: Abutting periosteum - can get away with a marginal
mandibulectomy. Invasion of mandible - need a segmental
resection



- 

N0 necks: elective ipsi/bilateral (b/l if midline) level I-III
(Can avoid neck dissection in T1/2 N0 lower lips).



- 

N1+ neck: selective I-III ND.



- 

RT if positive nodes. Chemotherapy if adverse features (positive
margins, ECS on LNs)




### 
Oropharyngeal CA



**Sites**:



- 

Tonsil: MC, aggressive, high risk of occult LN spread



- 

Base of tongue: also aggressive w/ high rates of LN
spread



- 

Posterior pharyngeal wall and soft palate = less
aggressive





T1-T2: excision vs primary XRT.



N0: XRT or elective unilateral or bilateral ND levels II-IV.



N1: XRT selective ND II-IV.



N2-3: Chemorads + selective ND



T3-T4: typically treated with radiation


### 
Laryngeal CA


#### 
Premalignant
Glottic Lesions



- 

Hyperplasia/Hyperkeratosis - not a risk for
malignancy



- 

Dysplasia



- 

Severe dysplasia/Carcinoma in situ- risk is 15-25%



- 

CIS has features of malignancy but not invaded beyond basement
membrane



- 

Excisions



- 

Microflap excision: Dissects superficial lamina propria and
spares vocal ligament




#### 
Hypopharyngeal CA



- 

Hypopharynx: Level of hyoid bone to the cricopharyngeus behind
the larynx



- 

**Piriform sinus** is most common location



- 

Post-cricoid region: think plummer-vinson syndrome



- 

Most are diagnosed at advanced stage



- 

Hypopharynx may have skip lesions



- 

Management



- 

T1, some T2, N0 - partial laryngopharygectomy



- 

Always do Level II-IV neck dissection even in N0 disease



- 

Techniques



- 

**Partial laryngopharyngectomy**



- 

For T1 (some T2) piriform sinus cancer



- 

Must involve **medial wall** and be **1.5cm
away from apex**



- 

**Lateral + suprahyoid pharyngectomy**



- 

For posterior cricopharyngeal wall CA



- 

Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy



- 

For advance CA and post-cricoid CA



- 

For these, need reconstruction with tension-free
closure.




#### 
LARYNGEAL



- 

Sites



- 

**Supraglottis**: High rate of note metastasis.
Typically to bilateral II-IV



- 

**Glottis**: Most common site in larynx



- 

Less spread due to barriers (vocal ligament, thyroglottic
ligament)



- 

Anterior commissure - no inner perichondrium allows for
anterior spread to thyroid cartilage



- 

**Subglottic**: Rare, poor prognosis



- 

Treatments



- 

Laser surgery



- 

Ideal for T1 glottic or supraglottic SCCA. Risk of
scarring



- 

**Anterior commissure involvement** - associated
with high recurrence rates



- 

Surgery



- 

Cordectomy---Indication: T1 glottic cancer restricted to middle
1/3 of vocal fold



- 

Conservative/Function Laryngectomies:



- 

Contraindication to partial laryngectomies is poor pulmonary
function



- 

Vertical partial laryngectomy (Hemi laryngectomy)



- 

high risk of aspiration, must have really go pulmonary

- 

Can decrease risk by **turning to operated side**
and performing a **chin tuck**



- 

T1/T2 glottic CA that doesn't extend beyond 1/3 of opposite cord
or involve posterior commissure



- 

Supraglottic partial laryngectomy (Horizontal
Hemi-laryngectomy)



- 

For **T1/T2 *supraglottic* tumors**



- 

preservation of both true vocal cords and arytenoids - preserves
voice



- 

Disadvantage: needs initial trach, increased aspiration risk as
SLN is taken



- 

Supracricoid partial laryngectomy



- 

Must preserve one functional cricoarytenoid unit
(arytenoid, cricoid and hyoid and associated musculature, plus the
superior and recurrent laryngeal nerve)



- 

Resects supraglottis plus vocal fold, thyroid cartilage, and
paraglottic space



- 

**Select T3/T3 supraglottic/glottic CA** - must not
have **arytenoid fixation**



- 

Open partial laryngectomy: Resects anterior commissure for select
cases



- 

**Contraindications**:



- 

Cartilage invasion, **VF fixation**, interarytenoid
involvement, tongue base involvement, poor performance status



- 

Total laryngectomy:



- 

With addition of pharyngeal structures such as piriform sinus or
laryngeal pharyngeal wall if needed



- 

Radiation: Used for T1/T2 lesions



- 

Neck Dissections



- 

Hypopharyngeal: Yes starting at T1 (With T2 or N1, should also do
Level VI)



- 

Supraglottic: yes for T1 N0
