# Tinnitus â€“ *Clinical Practice Guideline*

* **Audiogram** is essential if tinnitus is:
  * Unilateral
  * Persistent >6 months
  * Associated with hearing loss
  * *Dr. Sillman* recommends audiograms for all tinnitus due to high incidence of high-tone SNHL (can recommend hearing aids if confirmed)
* **Imaging**: not routinely done
  * Only if tinnitus is:
    * Unilateral/asymmetric hearing loss
    * Neurological symptoms
* **Treatment**:
  * Observe if <6 months and not bothersome
  * If bothersome and persistent (>6 months):
    * **Sound therapy** (e.g., white noise machines)
    * **Cognitive behavioral therapy**
    * **Hearing aids** (*only if hearing loss present*)
* **Not recommended**: dietary supplements, deep-brain stimulation, medical therapy
* *Dr. Sillman* may recommend meditation
