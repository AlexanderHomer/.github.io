## Otology - Clinic Guide

#### Sillman/Noonan Clinic

·  Use the new patient or follow up visit templates for the physician exam

·  For the ear exam: use the microscope. Put “Microscopic exam in the ear section”

·  For vertigo patients: do dix-hallpike, head thrust, rhomberg, Fukuda stepping tests +/- checking vibratory sensation, finger to nose prn

·  Assessments in the assessment/problem section with the ICD-9 codes

·  Keep the plans short. Put a plan for each problem listed.

·  including discussions regarding dry ear precautions. Put observation if no specific plan was proposed

·  Put in the Attestation template and replace the \*\*\* with your name

·  Under follow up, put the time frame + “sooner prn.” Do NOT press done

### Audiology

·  **PTA (pure tone)**: Hearing sensitivity at 500,1000,2000Hz

·  **SRT** - lowest threshold **spondee** can be repeated 50% of time

·  **WRS (word rec)** - % correct of a 50 word list of __monosyllabic phonetically balanced words.__ Given at 40dB greater than SRT

·  **Hearing loss levels:**  go down by 15dB starting at <25dB

Audiogram symbols: Right = O, Left = X (triangle for right masking, square for left masking → THINK ROLEX)

#### Audiogram Patterns

A  **2kHz notch** (air-bone) otosclerosis

B  **4kHz notch** (SNHL) - noise exposure

C  **Cookie bite** – hereditary

D  **Low Frequency** (SNHL) — Meniere’s

#### Tympanometry

\*\*Ad = __D__\*\*eep for \*\*__d__\*\*iscontinuity

As= \*\*__s__**hallow for oto**__s__\*\*clerosis /ossicular fixation

B + volume wnl: OME

B + large volume: perforation

C: ETD, retraction

#### Acoustic Reflex Testing

Image to the right are common patterns (Red = absent. Green = present)

**Right/Left**: the side of the sound stimulus.

**Ipsilateral/Contralateral**: side that the reflect stimulus is detected.

**Note**: Acoustic reflexes should be __absent__ in __CHL__ (otosclerosis etc) __unless__ patients have __semicircular canal dehiscence.__

OAEs:      __T__**EOAE - newborn testing.**  __D__POAE - think __d__ouble tones (2 pure-tone freq.) DPOAE are good f or screening ototoxicity/noise toxicity

ECoG: Basically measuring Wave I on a ABR. The big thing to know is **__>0.45 SP/AP__** is associated with **__Meniere's__**

ABR:  **__Wave V latency__** (>0.2ms) due to retrocochlear pathology

A  Abnormal wave I-V and III-V latency = CHL
