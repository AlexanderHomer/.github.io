Otology - Clinic Guide


#### 
Sillman/Noonan Clinic



- 

Use the new patient or follow up visit templates for the physician exam



- 

For the ear exam: use the microscope. Put "Microscopic exam in the ear section"



- 

For vertigo patients: do dix-hallpike, head thrust, rhomberg, Fukuda stepping tests +/- checking vibratory sensation, finger to nose prn





- 

Assessments in the assessment/problem section with the ICD-9 codes



- 

Keep the plans short. Put a plan for each problem listed.



- 

![](../media/image3.png)including discussions regarding dry ear precautions. Put observation if no specific plan was proposed





- 

Put in the Attestation template and replace the \*\*\* with your name



- 

Under follow up, put the time frame + "sooner prn." Do NOT press done




### 
Audiology



- 

**PTA (pure tone)**: Hearing sensitivity at 500,1000,2000Hz



- 

**SRT** - lowest threshold **spondee** can be repeated 50% of time



- 

**WRS (word rec)** - % correct of a 50 word list of monosyllabic phonetically balanced words. Given at 40dB greater than SRT



- 

**Hearing loss levels:** go down by 15dB starting at \
#### 
Audiogram Patterns



- 

**2kHz notch** (air-bone) otosclerosis



- 

**4kHz notch** (SNHL) - noise exposure



- 

**Cookie bite** -- hereditary



- 

**Low Frequency** (SNHL) --- Meniere's




#### 
Tympanometry


**

**Ad = D**eep for **d**iscontinuity



As= **s**hallow for oto**s**clerosis /ossicular fixation



B + volume wnl: OME



B + large volume: perforation



C: ETD, retraction



#### 
Acoustic Reflex Testing



Image to the right are common patterns (Red = absent. Green = present)



**Right/Left**: the side of the sound stimulus.



**Ipsilateral/Contralateral**: side that the reflect stimulus is detected.



**Note**: Acoustic reflexes should be absent in CHL (otosclerosis etc) unless patients have semicircular canal dehiscence.



**OAEs**: T**EOAE - newborn testing.** DPOAE - think double tones (2 pure-tone freq.) DPOAE are good f or screening ototoxicity/noise toxicity



**ECoG**: Basically measuring Wave I on a ABR. The big thing to know is **\>0.45 SP/AP** is associated with **Meniere's**



**ABR**: **Wave V latency** (\>0.2ms) due to retrocochlear pathology



- 

Abnormal wave I-V and III-V latency = CHL
