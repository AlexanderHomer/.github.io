Otitis


#### 
Acute Otitis Externa -- Clinical Practice Guideline



- 

![](../media/image7.jpeg)**Diagnosis**: rapid onset (over 2 days) + ear pain, itchiness, fullness + EITHER signs of ear canal fullness (tenderness of tragus/pinnae) OR diffuse canal edema. Otorrhea is not needed for diagnosis. **MCC**: P aeruginosa + staph aureus. **Eval for**: Hx of T2DM, HIV, hx of XRT/immunocompromised. **Check for** TM perforation/Tubes -- ciprodex/ofloxacin are the only drops if perforation/tubes are present. If cranial nerve palsy or granulation tissue on inferior aspect of canal (at bony-cartilaginous junction): consider malignant otitis externa (which is AOE + osteomyelitis of skull base)



- 

**Tx**: **Topical Abx:** Ciprodex/cipro HC, cortisporin, acetic acid (Vinegar), Vosol HC (acetic acid+hydrocortisone). Dosing should be at least BID, for 7-10days Don't give systemic antibiotics unless patients are high risk: T2DM, HIV, **Tell patients how to apply otic drops**: lie with affected ear up. Put drops. Tragus pump to help. Stay in position x3-5mins.



- 

When to place ear wick: If EAC edema means TM cannot be seen



- 

![](../media/image8.jpeg)Follow up should be in 2-3 days




#### 
Malignant Otitis Externa



-granulation tissue in EAC at bony-cartilaginous junction



-CN7→X→XI involvement



-Technetium-99 (osteoblastic) to establish dx



Gallium-67 to follow.



-Tx: anti-pseudomonas Abx. Topical antibiotics. Debridement. Hyperbaric oxygen


#### 
Chronic Otitis Externa



-\>6weeks of persistent OE.



-first try **mineral oil** 2-3 drops at night. F/U in 2 months



-next can try **DermOtic** (fluocinolone) if that doesn't work


#### 
Fungal Otitis External (Otomycosis)



MCC: aspergillus. Exam shows sheets of keratin with black conidophores on top of white filamentous hyphae. Tx: acetic acid (vinegar) vs c**lotrimazole 1% solution (lotrimin)**, glucose control, dry ear precautions. Consider gentian violet or methyl-cresyl actate for refractors cases


### 
Tinnitus-**Clinical Practice Guideline**




- definitely get audiogram for tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (\>6months) or associated with hearing loss. Note: Dr. Sillman says every tinnitus patient should get an audiogram as they often have high-tone SNHL (if hearing loss, can recommend hearing aids)
  

  
  -In general, don't get imaging. Only get imaging if tinnitus + either unilateral/asymmetric hearing loss or neurological abnormalities
  

  
  -Tx: can observe for bothersome tinnitus that has lasted for \6months) guideline recommends: **sound therapy** (white noise machine), **cognitive behavior therapy**, and **hearing aids** (ONLY IF patients have hearing loss). Guideline recommend against: dietary supplements, deep-brain stimulation, medical therapy. Dr Sillman also likely to recommend meditation.
  

  ### 
  Otosclerosis
  

  
  - 
  
  Ask: Progressive CHL beginning in 20-40yo. Strong family history (**Autosomal Dominant w/ incomplete penetrance)**. Often have tinnitus. Hear better in noise
  

  
  - 
  
  Exam: Schwartze sign (red hue behind TM). Audiogram: look for Carharts notch @ 2kHz (CO2: Carhart notch in Otosclerosis at 2Khz). Absent acoustic reflex. Shallow tympanometry (As: for Otosclerosis)
  

  
  - 
  
  DDx: SSCD (has present acoustic reflexes). Congenital stapes fixation (CHl since birth), Ossicular fixation (2/2 tympanosclerosis: presents w/ same findings/audiogram -- hard to differentiate), Paget's disease/Osteopetrosis (imaging is different)
  

  
  - 
  
  Tx: hearing aids or stapedectomy (criteria for stapedectomy: 25dB air-bone gap) w/ good bone line, good word rec)
  

  
  - 
  
  Stapedectomy: things to check:
  

  
  - 
  
  Only 1 good ear = contraindication. If both ears are bad: initial surgery on poorer ear
  

  
  - 
  
  Check CT for:
  

  
  - 
  
  Widened IAC: associated w/ stapes gusher
  

  
  - 
  
  Check for middle meningeal artery: patients may have persistent stapedial artery.
  

  
  
  
  
  
  - 
  
  Floating footplate: if footplate becomes mobile after stapes superstructure removed
  

  
  - 
  
  If retrievable, remove. If non-retrievable: abort and wait for plate to refix
  

  
  
  
  
  ### 
  Facial Nerve
  

  
  **Intracranial segment**: gives of Nervus intermedius -- contributes to GSPN and chorda tympani -\> **meatal**: through IAC to fundus -\> **labyrinthine**: shortest segment -- goes to geniculate ganglion and gives of GSPN \[gives off pregang. Parasymp to lacrimal gland\] -\> **tympanic** : goes inferior to HSCC & above oval window/stapes (which is why you down-fracture stapes) -\> mastoid segment
  

  
  **Management of FN paralysis**:
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBI**-**V (Day 0-14)**: Give 14 day course of prednisone and have them f/u within 1 week. If progressed to HBVI at f/u, get a ENoG,
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBVI (Day 0-3):** Give 14 day course of prednisone, f/u within 1 week
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBVI (Day3-14)**: Get ENoG. If \>90% degeneration: Get EMG: decompress nerve if EMG is negative, observe if positive. If \30db in 3 consecutive frequencies
  

  
  - 
  Clinician's should exclude CHL
  
  - 
  Assess for modifying factors: check for bilateral SNHL, recurrent episodes, associated vertigo or eye symptoms or focal defects
  
  - 
  Do not order CT head/brain for presumptive SSNHL.
  
  - 
  Obtain audiogram to confirm diagnosis
  
  - 
  Do not obtain lab testing
  
  - 
  We SHOULD r/o retrocochlear pathology w/ MRI, ABR, or audio followup
  
  - 
  Counsel patients on natural history of idiopathic SSNHL:
  
  \~1/3 to 2/3 of patients recover some function within 2 weeks.
  

  
  If no return of hearing within 2 weeks, less likely to recover
  

  
  - 
  Can (but not required) initiate steroid treatment (prednisone 1mg/kg/d (max 60mg/d), methylprednisone 48mg/d or decadron 10mg/d) for 7-14 days then taper over similar time. Offer up to 6 weeks out.
  
  - 
  Can give hyperbaric oxygen therapy within 3 months of disease
  
  - 
  Don't give any other meds (antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, antioxidants)
  
  - 
  Can offer intratympanic steroids for those who fail initial therapy"
  
  - 
  Decadron: 24mg/mL or 16mg/mL (compound) or 10mg/mL (stock)
  
  - 
  Methylprednisolone: 30-40mg/mL
  
  - 
  Inject 0.4-0.8mL into middle ear q3-7 days for 3-4 sessions. Keep head and affected ear up for 15-30mins after injection
  
  - 
  Repeat audio in 6 months
  
  - 
  If no improvement, should offer hearing aids
