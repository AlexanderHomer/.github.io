## Steps to a Mastoidectomy / Cochlear Implant:

* Get a **6 cutting** burr: Drill out Trotman’s triangle (temporal line, parallel to EAC, and sigmoid)
* Always keep the corner of the EAC/Temporal line as your deepest point and **saucerize**
* Get your exposure
* Make sure you **hug the tegmen** – the tegmen is the roof of the mastoid antrum and will lead you directly to it
* Thin the posterior EAC (put your suction into the EAC and really thin it out)
* Get through **Koerner’s Septum** → you should enter the antrum and see the lateral SCC
* Switch to **3 cutting burr**: Drill away the inferior/anterior part of the antrum until you see the fossa incus (and its reflection) → incus points to the facial recess
* Thin the posterior EAC some more
* Switch to a **2 coarse diamond**: start drilling the facial recess. There are air cells above the facial recess (sentinel cells). Show yourself the cochlear.
  * Practice a cochleostomy with a 1 fine diamond burr
