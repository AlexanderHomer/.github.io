\*\* Begin: \*\*After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought into the operating room and
placed in supine position. A time out was performed to verify the patient, procedure and side of
surgery. The patient was then induced and intubated by anesthesia. The incision was marked and
injected with \_cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. The patient was then prepped and draped in the
usual sterile fashion

extubated without complication. The patient was then transported to the PACU in stable condition. Dr
