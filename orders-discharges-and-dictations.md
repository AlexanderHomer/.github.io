\*\* Begin: \*\*After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought into the operating room and
placed in supine position. A time out was performed to verify the patient, procedure and side of
surgery. The patient was then induced and intubated by anesthesia. The incision was marked and
injected with \_cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. The patient was then prepped and draped in the
usual sterile fashion
```{=html}

```
```{=html}

```
`<strong>`{=html}End:`</strong>`{=html} ...this concluded the procedure. The patient was turned over to the care of anesthesia and
extubated without complication. The patient was then transported to the PACU in stable condition. Dr
\_\_\_, the attending surgeon, was present throughout the entire case.
