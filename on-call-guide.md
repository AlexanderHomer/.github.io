Calls
</h2>
<h4>
Post-tonsillectomy patients
</h4>
<p>
· `<strong>Bleeding:`</strong> Ask all tonsil bleeds to go to an ED. If sounds like a large active bleed, they go
to the nearest ED, otherwise they come to us.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Fever:`</strong> Fever is expected for up to 2 weeks. If fever continues, can consider course of
azithromycin (sometimes adenoid bed can become infected)
</p>
<p>
· Neck Pain: A small amount of neck pain is expected (typically from suspension or the
adenoidectomy). If the patient cannot move their neck, send patient to ED for CT to r/o Grisel's
syndrome (especially if patient has down syndrome)
</p>
<p>
· Pain: check if patient has been able to receive pain meds (often parents can't get kids to drink
the meds). Offer PR Tylenol to help catch up pain
</p>
<h4>
Post Septorhinoplasty Q&A
</h4>
<p>
· Duration of swelling/bruising: 7-10days. Ways to reduce: sit up, apply ice
</p>
<p>
· When can I blow nose: gentile blowing starts 1-week post-op
</p>
<p>
· When should nasal drainage stop? 2-3 days postop
</p>
<p>
· When can I resume sports: light exercise 2-3 weeks. Sports where nose could be injured (ball-
sports/contact sports) 3 months.
</p>
<p>
· When does nasal fullness/congestion subside -- few weeks to a month
</p>
<p>
· When can I return to work -- probably 1 week. Sooner if they are up to it but need to take it easy
w/ lifting and moving
</p>
<p>
· Can I use my CPAP post-op -- No (especially if cosmetic or osteotomies are performed since mask
sits on nose + packing is in nose). May be able to start after packing removed at 1-week post-op
check (Dr. Lee is typically okay once packing comes out). Tell patients to sit up or discuss with
sleep specialist
</p>
<p>
· When can I wear sunglasses: Can wear them over splint. Once splint comes off, if possible, try
and avoid glasses on bridge of nose for another 1 week (especially if osteotomies done) but can wear
them if needed -- just try and take them off for small periods of time.
</p>
<p>
· When can I fly? 2-3 weeks post-op
</p>
<p>

<p>
A Before showering, coat a small piece of cotton with a tablespoon of Vaseline ointment. Gently
insert the cotton ball into the ear canal and keep in for the duration of the shower.
</p>
<p>
B If swimming or bathing is desired, purchase earplugs and a headband to keep earplugs from falling
out.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Sinus Precautions`</strong> :
</p>
<p>
A Blowing your nose: Do not pinch your nose: do not blow your nose. You can gently wipe your nose
if needed.
</p>
<p>
B Sneezing: If you must sneeze, keep your mouth open and do not pinch your nose closed.
</p>
<p>
C Sucking in air/liquid: Do not drink though a straw. Do not smoke.
</p>
<p>
D Blowing out air: Do not play a wind instrument. Do not blow up balloons.
</p>
<p>
E Pushing or lifting: Do not lift or push objects weighing more than 20 pounds. Avoid strenuous
activity. Please use soft softeners.
</p>
<p>
F Bending over: Keep your head above the level of your heart. Sleep with your head slightly raised
</p>
<h2>
Consults
</h2>
<h4>
Epistaxis
</h4>
<p>
· Most bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.
</p>
<p>
· Check for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry environment, cocaine use. Check the BP,
coags, platelets. Find out which side the bleed started
</p>
<p>
· Bring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope, phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel,
Surgifoam, Bactroban, ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 & #9 Frazier
tip suction, silver nitrate cautery. Can bring thrombigel or ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you
want to get fancy
</p>
<p>
· Think posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there is a hx of malignancy or trauma.
Also, can hide on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from
behind the maxillary sinus) For posterior bleeds, can use:
</p>
<p>
A 10F Foley -- Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/ 10cc, pull until balloon wedges
against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal alar. Monitor for palate necrosis
</p>
<p>
B Epistat -- put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with 7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw
until balloon wedges against posterior nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.
</p>
<p>
C Ant/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) -- works well. Inflate until the patient can't tolerate it
anymore
</p>
<p>
D Rule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires hospital admission and pulse ox
monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia you are monitoring for)
</p>
<p>
· It's never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both sides, take at least one of them
<p>
· ED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see an epistaxis patient, your job
is to find out where the bleeding is coming from and why it is happening. `<strong>Find the bleeding
source`</strong>
</p>
<p>
· Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet forceps, gently feed it along the
floor of the nasal cavity. You should get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way
back and not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold pressure for 5-10mins.
This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and numb everything up so that you can look. Use a
0-degree scope and a Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties back bit
by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you visualize it. This will show you where the
bleeding is coming from.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>If its anterior`</strong> and a vessel can be seen, use a silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make
sure you dry the area before and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop
down onto patients' lips and discolor their skin.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>If its further back (mid septum)`</strong> , wrap surgicel around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and
press it against the area that's bleeding.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>If it's posterior: use a posterior pack`</strong>. Pumping vessels posteriorly will likely need to the
OR to stop. Try medializing the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior
aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>If it's an HHT patient`</strong>. Surgiflo seems to work best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with
it.
</p>
<h4>
PTAs
</h4>
<p>
· CBC w/ Diff; Rapid Strep; `<em>Monospot`</em>
</p>
<p>
· Decadron 10 mg IV x 1 (only if drained or neg needle aspiration + neg CT for abscess;
</p>
<p>
· Unasyn IV or Clindamycin (PCN allergic) x1 only if CBC shows no atypical lymphocytes & monospot
is negative; then continue PO x 7-14 days
</p>
<p>
· To Drain: yankeur suction at bedside, 18-gauge needle, \>27-gauge needle, 10 mL syringe, 5 mL
syringe, lidocaine with epi, tongue depressor, 15 blade, Kelly clamp, hurricane spray
</p>
<p>
· Hurricane spray -\> lido w/ epi -\> You can needle aspirate to localize the region. March down the
side of the peritonsillar space, it can be lower than you think. When you strike gold, send it for
culture, then do an I&D w/ a #15 blade and spread with clamp.
</p>
<p>
· Low threshold to scope (unless you have a CT) to clear the airway as edema can track down
</p>
<h4>
Tracheostomy
</h4>
<p>
· Family discussion completed by primary team (you aren't responsible for that talk)
</p>
<p>
· Coagulation
</p>
<p>
A Platelet, H/H, INR/PTT
</p>
<p>
B Anticoagulation (why? Can it be shut off) -- lovenox stop 24hrs before, heparin gtt 4-5 hours
before - see anticoagulation guide
</p>
<p>
· Intubation hx (PEEP (PEEP \>8 makes trachs much more difficult -- pts quickly desat, trach has
higher risk of dislodging) duration, traumatic? Tube size? Extubation attempts, exposure)
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Operative Steps:`</strong> Place shoulder roll. mark out midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid,
sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep
& drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop skin bleeders. Use sennas on
superior and inferior aspects of incision and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down
w/ curved mets midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don't open to wide (you'll
get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating
for midline. Once you see straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes under
straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army navy. If trach dives deep, comes
from above thyroid over cricoid. Can also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie
coming up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia off trachea w/ a
peanut. Expose you window (2/3rd tracheal rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech
to test cuff, put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask anesthesia to
lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by making two horizontal incisions over 2nd and
3rd tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of trachea between cuts and
use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask
anesthesia to withdraw circuit until it's just above window then, if you have time, place a stay
suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia
circuit, wait for CO2 return, secure trach w/ 4-point sutures & Velcro trach tie.
</p>
<h4>
Angioedema
</h4>
<p>
· Look for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema. Always scope to r/o airway edema.
</p>
<p>
· Labs: get complement protein C4 levels and C1-INH (low levels -\> suspect C1 esterase deficiency).
Also get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP, ESR
</p>
<p>
· Causes: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs
</p>
<p>
· Time frame:
</p>
<p>
A Histamine related - comes & goes within 12 hours
</p>
<p>
B Lisinopril related -- can take 2 days for swelling to decrease
</p>
<p>
C Hereditary angioedema -- can take DAYS
</p>
<p>
· Rec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.
</p>
<p>
· If hereditary angioedema, can consider:
</p>
<p>
A Purified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest).
</p>
<p>
B Ecallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)
</p>
<p>
C Icatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist
</p>
<p>
· If significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise admit to MICU overnight for
airway monitoring and rescope in morning
</p>
<p>
· Have a game plan for intubation -- speak to Anesthesia to notify that patient is being admitted,
provide plan for intubation, nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.
</p>
<h4>
Parotitis/Sialadenitis
</h4>
<p>
· MASH: Massage, antibiotics, sialagogues (lemon drops, orange wedges), hydration/heat.
</p>
<h4>
Ear Foreign Body
</h4>
<p>
· Always ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with tuning fork exam
</p>
<p>
· Ask the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan) is rarely enough
</p>
<p>
· Get a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it behind the foreign body and pop it
out
</p>
<p>
· If the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid putting in drops as this could
cause the foreign body to swell
</p>
<h4>
Fish Bone
</h4>
<p>
· Do a fiberoptic exam. If you can't see it, offer a thin-cut CT w/o contrast through the larynx
</p>
<p>
· If fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4% lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a
uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb the posterior oropharynx
</p>
<p>
· Use the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill forceps
</p>
<p>
· Have a nurse wrap patient's tongue with gauze and pull it out to improve access.
</p>
<p>
· For children, its often easier to go to the OR.
</p>
<h4>
Orbital Cellulitis
</h4>
<p>
· `<strong>Preseptal`</strong>`<strong>vs Orbital Cellulitis`</strong> :
</p>
<p>
A Orbital cellulitis is likely to have `<strong>chemosis`</strong> , pain with EOMI, restricted eye movement
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>When to drain a subperiosteal abscess?`</strong> If the abscess volume is \<1250mm3 can avoid OR
(measure abscess in 3 dimensions WxDxL in mm)
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>How to tell if there is a cavernous sinus thrombosis`</strong> : get a MRI with contrast.
</p>
<p>
A Look at DTI/DWI (isoDTI) - if the Cavernous sinus lights up, strong indication for Cavernous
sinus thrombosis. Look for edema. If in the vessels, think of thrombophlebitis.
</p>
<p>
1 Rule out shine through. ADC map (dDTI) should be the opposite of the DWI (isoDTI) if it's true.
If they are the same, this is shine through effect.
</p>
<p>
B On T1 post contrast- look for filling defect. Then confirm on DWI
</p>
<p>
1 1-2mm should be size of superior ophthalmic vein. Expect it to be dilated on both sides
</p>
<h4>
Airway patients with stridor
</h4>
<p>
· Ask: onset of stridor + speed of progression. Eval for infectious vs inflammatory vs foreign body
vs neoplastic
</p>
<p>
· Evaluate: O2 sat, respiratory rate, retractions, ability to lay supine. Stridor: insp:
supraglottic/glottic. Biphasic: glottic/subglottic. Expiratory: trachea/bronchi. `<strong>Perform
fiberoptic exam and check airway`</strong>
</p>
<p>
· Management`<strong>:`</strong>
</p>
<p>
1 `<em>Airway widely patent and mild edema, slow progression of symptoms`</em> → observation on floor w/ O2
monitoring
</p>
<p>
2 `<em>Airway patent but moderate edema (e.g. angioedema patients)`</em> → observation in ICU
</p>
<p>
3 `<em>Unable to entire airway`</em> → OR for awake fiberoptic intubation w/ possible awake trach
</p>
<p>
4 `<em>Unable to see any airway`</em> → OR for awake trach
</p>
<p>
B Surgical Airway patients
</p>
<p>
1 Alert an attending
</p>
<p>
2 Nasal trumpet, Heliox if increased WOB
</p>
<p>
3 Bag Mask (may not be the best) or LMA
</p>
<p>
4 If stable, perform fiberoptic exam. If intubation needed, try and do in OR
</p>
<h4>
Pediatric Stridor
</h4>
<p>
· Scope with nursing and bag mask equipment available. Always ask the NICU RN before you even touch
a kid in the NICU
</p>
<p>
· When you scope, scope around the nasal cannula, don't remove it
</p>
<p>
· No reflux medications in NICU babies unless the attending clears it (causes NEC)
</p>
<p>
· DDX:
</p>
<p>
A Laryngomalacia
</p>
<p>
B VF immobility: see VF immobility workup in Pedi ENT section
</p>
<p>
C Complete tracheal rings
</p>
<p>
1 Get echo, head u/s +/- MRI
</p>
<p>
2 MBS if VF immobility
</p>
<p>
3 Low threshold for DLB
</p>
<h4>
Transfers
</h4>
<p>
· Never accept an unstable transfer.
</p>
<p>
· No direct admits unless one of our attendings has accepted it. In general, transfers go through
the ED
</p>
<h4>
Admissions from ED -- What service?
</h4>
<p>
In general, we have adopted the same model as Orthopedics.
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Admit to Medicine with ENT consult`</strong> : Adults with `<strong>non-surgical issue`</strong> (peritonsillar
phlegmon, angioedema) or `<strong>surgical issue + multiple co-morbidities`</strong> (taking medications for T2DM
and HTN) or is high risk (history of MI)
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Admit to ENT`</strong> : Adults with non-complicated surgical patients (e.g.: retropharyngeal abscess)
and those with post-op complications (unless it is purely medical e.g. poor PO intake, pain control
etc.).
</p>
<p>
· `<strong>Admit to Pediatrics`</strong> : Typically, all pediatric patients except those with post-surgical
complications go to Pediatrics
</p>
<p>
`<strong>General rule`</strong> : Be reasonable. Medicine are reasonable...which means they tend to get dumped on a
lot. We should take the simple patients onto our service. At the same time, recognize that we are in
the ORs during the day and are home-call at night so don't have the manpower to manage difficult
patients.
</p>
<p>
`<strong>Inpatient or bedded outpatient patients who had surgery`</strong> : they come to our service.
