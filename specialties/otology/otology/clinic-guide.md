# Otology - Clinic Guide

## Sillman/Noonan Clinic

* Use the new patient or follow up visit templates for the physician exam
  * For the ear exam: use the microscope. Put “Microscopic exam in the ear section”
  * For vertigo patients: do dix-hallpike, head thrust, **romberg**, Fukuda stepping tests +/- checking vibratory sensation, finger to nose prn
* Assessments in the assessment/problem section with the ICD-9 codes
* Keep the plans short. Put a plan for each problem listed.
  * including discussions regarding dry ear precautions. Put observation if no specific plan was proposed
* Put in the Attestation template and replace the \*\*\* with your name
* Under follow up, put the time frame + “sooner prn.” Do NOT press done


## Audiology

* **PTA (pure tone):** Hearing sensitivity at 500,1000,2000Hz
* **SRT:** lowest threshold **spondee** can be repeated 50% of time
* **WRS (word rec):** % correct of a 50 word list of **monosyllabic phonetically balanced words**. Given at 40dB greater than SRT
* **Hearing loss levels:** go down by 15dB starting at <25dB
* **Audiogram symbols:**
  * Right = O
  * Left = X
  * (triangle for right masking, square for left masking → THINK ROLEX)


### Audiogram Patterns

* **2kHz notch** (air-bone) – otosclerosis
* **4kHz notch** (SNHL) – noise exposure
* **Cookie bite** – hereditary
* **Low Frequency** (SNHL) – Meniere’s


### Tympanometry

 ![Tympanogram Types](../media/image3.png "right-50")

* **Ad:** Deep for **discontinuity**
* **As:** Shallow for otosclerosis / ossicular fixation
* **B + volume wnl:** OME
* **B + large volume:** perforation
* **C:** ETD, retraction

### Acoustic Reflex Testing

* Image to the right are common patterns (Red = absent, Green = present)
* **Right/Left:** side of the sound stimulus
* **Ipsilateral/Contralateral:** side that the reflex stimulus is detected
* **Note:** Acoustic reflexes should be **absent in CHL** (otosclerosis etc) unless patients have **semicircular canal dehiscence**


### OAEs

* **__T__EOAE** - newborn testing
* **__D__POAE** – think **double tones** (2 pure-tone freq.)
  * DPOAE are good for screening ototoxicity/noise toxicity


### ECochG

* Basically measuring Wave I on an ABR
* The big thing to know is **>0.45 SP/AP** is associated with **Meniere’s**


### ABR

* **Wave V latency** (>0.2ms) due to **retrocochlear** pathology
* Abnormal wave I–V and III–V latency = CHL


### Reflex Table

| Stimulus | Ipsilateral | Contralateral |
|----|----|----|
| Right | **Right Cochlear pathology** | **Right Cochlear pathology** |
| Left |    |    |
| Right | **Right FN weakness** |    |
| Left |    | **Right FN weakness** |
| Right | **Right Middle ear pathology** |    |
| Left |    |    |
| Right |    | **Brainstem** |
| Left |    | **Brainstem** |
