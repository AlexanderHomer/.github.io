# Facial Nerve

## Intracranial segment:

Gives off Nervus intermedius – contributes to GSPN and chorda tympani

* **→ meatal**: through IAC to fundus
* **→ labyrinthine**: shortest segment – goes to geniculate ganglion and gives off GSPN
  * Gives off **greater petrosal nerve** (parasymp. to lacrimal gland)
* **→ tympanic**: goes inferior to HSCC & above oval window/stapes
  * reason for down-fracturing stapes during decompression
* **→ mastoid segment**


## Management of FN paralysis:

* **HBI–V (Day 0–14)**:Give **14-day** course of prednisone, follow up in 1 week. If progressed to HBVI at follow-up, get an **ENoG**.
* **HBVI (Day 0–3)**:Give **14-day** prednisone, f/u within 1 week
* **HBVI (Day 3–14)**:Get **ENoG**. If >90% degeneration: Get EMG.
  * If EMG is positive: observe
  * If negative: decompress nerve
  * If <90% degeneration: continue prednisone


# Bell’s Palsy – *Clinical Practice Guideline*

* **Dx**: Usually rapid onset unilateral FN paresis/paralysis
  * **R/O** stroke, parotid mass, systemic/infection causes
  * Ask about **Sarcoidosis** (Heerfordt fever)
  * Guidelines: **no lab or imaging tests needed**
  * If complete paralysis (HBVI): can offer **ENoG/EMG** (after 7 days)
  * If HBI→HBV: don’t need nerve testing
* **Tx**:
  * **Eye protection**: tape eyes at night, eye drops
  * **Steroids within 72 hours** of symptoms:
    * At least 5 days high dose, then taper
  * Can add antivirals, but limited evidence
  * **Follow-up**: in 3 months unless worse symptoms sooner
* **Counseling**:
  * Recovery starts in 2–3 weeks, typically complete in 3–4 months
  * **HBVI (complete paralysis)**: \~70% recovery
  * **HB1→HBV**: \~94% recovery


# Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss – *Clinical Practice Guideline*

* Non-CPG reccomendations in 

  > italic boxes
* Audiometric criteria: decrease in hearing of >30 dB in 3 consecutive frequencies

### 1. Confirm it’s SNHL (not CHL)

### 2. Assess modifying factors:

* Check for bilateral SNHL, recurrent episodes, associated vertigo, eye symptoms, or focal deficits

  > * *Rule out: **vestibular schwannoma**, stroke, autoimmune, syphilis, recent URI/meds*
  > * *Meniere’s and MS also on differential*

### 3. Don’t order CT head/brain for presumptive SSNHL

### 4. Get audiogram to confirm diagnosis

### 5. Don’t order labs routinely

> If history suggests: consider RPR, FTA-ABS (syphilis), ESR, RF, ANA, Lyme

### 6. Order MRI (or ABR or audiology follow-up) to r/o **retrocochlear** pathology

> ABR if MRI not feasible. Audio f/u can be offered with informed consent

### 7. Counsel on natural course:

* \~1/3 to 2/3 recover within 2 weeks
* If no improvement by 2 weeks → worse prognosis


## Treatment

### 8. Steroids (optional but reasonable)

* Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg)
* OR Methylprednisolone 48 mg/day
* OR Decadron 10 mg/day
* Course: 7–14 days, taper over similar time
* Can offer up to 6 weeks out

### 9. Hyperbaric oxygen:

* Within 3 months of disease

### 10. Avoid other medication:

* Antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, antioxidants, etc

### 11. Intratympanic steroids:

* For those who fail oral treatment
* Dosing:
  * Decadron: 24 mg/mL or 16 mg/mL (compounded) or 10 mg/mL (stock)
  * Methylprednisolone: 30–40 mg/mL
  * Inject 0.4–0.8 mL into middle ear q3–7 days × 3–4 sessions
  * Keep head and affected ear up for 15–30 mins after injection

### 12. Repeat audiogram in 6 months

### 13. If no improvement, offer hearing aids
