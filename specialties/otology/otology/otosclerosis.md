# Otosclerosis

* **Ask**: Progressive **CHL** beginning in 20–40yo
  * Strong family history
    * *Autosomal Dominant w/ incomplete penetrance*
  * Often have tinnitus
  * Hear better in noise
* **Exam**:
  * Schwartze sign (red hue behind TM)
  * Audiogram: look for **Carhart’s notch at 2kHz**
  * CO2 test: confirms Carhart notch
  * Absent acoustic reflex
  * Shallow tympanometry (A**s** for Oto**s**clerosis)
* **DDx**:
  * **SSCD** (presents similarly but has reflexes)
  * Congenital stapes fixation (CHL since birth)
  * Ossicular fixation ***secondary to*** Tympanosclerosis (same audiogram/findings, hard to differentiate)
  * Paget’s disease / Osteopetrosis (different imaging)
* **Tx**:
  * Hearing aids or **stapedectomy**
    * Criteria: 25dB air–bone gap
    * Good bone line = good prognosis


### Stapedectomy Checklist

* Only one good ear = contraindication
  * If both ears bad: **operate on worse ear first**
* Check **CT** for:

  
  1. **Widened IAC** → a/w stapes gusher
  2. **Middle meningeal artery** → patients may have persistent stapedial artery


### Floating Footplate

* If becomes mobile after removing stapes superstructure:
  * **If retrievable**: remove
  * **If non-retrievable**: abort and wait to refix
