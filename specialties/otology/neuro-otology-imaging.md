# Neuro-otology Imaging

## CT Temporal Bone:

**Stenvers/Perpendicular view**: a long-axis projection of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, perpendicular to axis of cochlear (best for seeing cochlear implant electrode array) and is used to depict the **round window, tegmen**, and **posterior semicircular canal**, as well as other structures.


**Poschl/Parallel view**: a short-axis view of the petrous pyramid, used to optimally visualize the **superior semicircular canal**


## How to Read Temporal Bone Images

**Divide into:** *EAC, Middle Ear, Inner Ear, Petrous Apex, Intratemporal Facial Nerve*


### External Auditory Canal (EAC):

* **Necrotizing otitis externa**: inflamed EAC and auricle w/ bony erosion of inferior EAC. T1 w/ contrast: cellulitis enhances. Same with T2
* **Cholesteatoma**: eroding mass in inferior, posterior EAC. MRI shows T1 iso/**hypointense**, T2 intermediate/high intensity. DWI is bright (aka restricted)
* **Keratosis Obturans**: does not have bony destruction
* **Exostoses (swimmers ears)**: **typically** at suture lines and are bilateral
* **Osteomas**: **Typically** ovoid <1cm
* **Canal Atresia/Stenosis**: look at ossicles – malleus/incus are typically fused. Oval window atresia


### Middle Ear

* **Cholesteatoma**: congenital by EAC, TM intact. Acquired in epitympanum (**Prussak’s space**), erodes scutum and ossicles. T1 dark, they don’t enhance. Bright(**ish**) on T2, Lights up on DWI
* **Aberrant Carotid Artery**: the carotid canal just continues into the middle ear
* **Glomus Tympanicum**: oval mass of cochlear promontory


### Inner Ear

* **Superior SSC dehiscence**
* **Cochlear abnormalities**: aplasia or common cavity
* **Enlarged vestibular aqueduct**: if >1.5mm. Look for Mondini malformation: think Pendred’s
* **Hypoplastic CN8**: If <3mm
* **Labyrinthitis**: T1 w/ contrast = enhances. Schwannoma has similar appearance but also has filling defect on T2
* **Otosclerosis**: demineralized bone over **otic capsule**


### Petrous Apex

* Most common abnormality is asymmetric marrow (T1 bright)
* **Mucocele**: breakdown of bony trabecular, T1 low, T2 high, rim enhancement
* **Cholesterol Granulomas**: expand from petrous apex. T1/T2 high. Well circumscribed w/ smooth edges
* **Chondrosarcoma**: look for **intratumoral** calcification


### Intratemporal Fossa

* **Vestibular schwannomas**: T1 iso, avidly enhance, T2 iso/high
* **Meningiomas**: similar to vestibular schwannomas but T2 is variable and have calcifications
* **Epidermoids**: T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense, doesn't enhance. Differentiated from arachnoid cysts as **epidermoids** are bright on DWI.

### General principles of MRI:

| Tissue Type | Fat | Soft Tissue | CSF/Water | Edema | Best for |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **T1W** | ↑ | ↔ | ↓ | ↓ | Marrow, Fat, SAH |
| **T1W w/ Gad** | ↔ | ↔/↑ | ↓ | ↓ | Infection, Tumor, Inflammation |
| **T2W** | ↓ | ↔ | ↑ | ↑ | Nerves |
| **FIESTA/CISS** | ↓ | ↓/↔ | ↑ | ↑ | Membranous labyrinth/IAC/Nerves |
| **FLAIR** | ↑ | ↔ | ↓ | ↑ | Epidermoids, SAH |
| **DWI** | ↓ | ↔ | ↓ | ↑ | Cholesteatomas |


### Pathology Imaging Characteristics

| Pathology | T1 | T2 | T1 w/ Gad | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Vestibular Schwannomas** | ↔ | ↑ | ↑ | Brighter than meningiomas on T2, Meningiomas tend to be broad against dural surface |
| **Glomus tumors (paragangliomas)** | ↔ | ↑ | ↑ | Salt & Pepper appearance of T1 |
| **Epidermoids/Arachnoid Cysts** | ↓ | ↑ | ↓ | Arachnoid cysts don't enhance, epidermoids light up on DWI |
| **Cholesterol Granuloma** | ↑ | ↑ | ↑ | – |
| **Cholesteatomas** | ↔ | ↑ | ↔ | Lights up on DWI |
