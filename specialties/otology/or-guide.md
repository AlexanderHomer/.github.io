# Otology – OR

## Dr. Sillman’s Tympanomastoidectomy

### Preparation:

* Remove the OR bed’s pad under the head and place yellow gel + towels. Keep the ear the same height as the shoulder.
* Always balance the microscope and make sure the teaching oculars are on the ipsilateral side of the operating ear, and the oculars are “zeroed.”
* Use NIM monitor for all mastoids.
* Use Bien Air drill (Large 3L normal saline bags are used if using **Midas Rex** drill).
* Turn table 180 degrees.
* **6,4 cutter**, **3,2,1 diamond**
* Prep with **10% betadine**
* Facial nerve leads:
  * **Orbicularis oris** (in nasolabial fold next to nose pointing down): gets zygomaticus and orbicularis
  * **Orbicularis oculi** (just above lateral eyebrow pointing down and lateral): gets frontal and orbicularis
* Use mupirocin in the hair to keep it out of your way.
* No thousand drapes. Use **blue towels**:
  * Start at shoulder, then posterior, superior, anterior. **Staple.**
* Use **crani drape**. Direct the head of the little man to the surgeon side.
* **Drape microscope**: don’t connect the lens first—do last. Put hand pieces in first.

### Incision:

* 1 cm behind postauricular crease
