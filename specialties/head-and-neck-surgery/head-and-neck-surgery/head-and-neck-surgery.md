## Head & Neck Surgery – Clinic Guide

### Dr. O’Leary’s Clinic




1. Correct the chief compliant. Put type/site of cancer TNM stage and treatment (with date) at the beginning of every note (T2N1M0 HPV+ left base of tongue SCCa s/p concomitant chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin completed on 10/13/2018.)
2. Use Dr O’Leary’s New patient or Follow up visit templates
3. ALWAYS CC op-note to primary care physician, other care providers (rad onc, med onc) and referring physician’
4. Spray the patients with Lidocaine/Afrin spray prior to presenting to Dr. O’Leary so there is enough time for local anesthesia and decongestion

### Dr. Wein’s Clinic

1\. if you can, dictate your notes and minimize the amount of templating

2\. always give patients a copy of their pathology, lab, or imaging results at the time of an office visit

3\. document and circle the appropriate spaces on the encounter form if:

* smoking cessation advised
* imaging/labs ordered or surgery booked
* imaging/labs/path reviewed
* procedures performed

4\. Always CC the corresponding MD at the end of the note with “CC: Andrew Scott, MD”, and not with less formal approaches like “Dr. Scott, PCP”

### Dr. Tracy’s Clinic

1\. Similar to Dr. O’Leary’s clinic flow

<span id="_Toc139824264" class="anchor"></span>Burning Mouth Consults: *Dr. O’Leary’s workup*

\-Obtain lab tests: ANA, SS-A, SS-B, TSH, fasting glucose, A1c, CBC w/ diff, ferritin, Vit B1, B2, B6, B12, folate, Mg2+, Zinc

\-Biopsy if visible lesion

\-can consider patch testing

### Aphthous ulcer treatments

triamcinolone acetonide with carboxymethylcellulose paste (Kenalog in Orabase)

Fluocinonide (Lidex) gel

Peridex mouthwash

Aphthasol paste – Aphthasol oral paste is usually applied 4 times each day--usually after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at bedtime.

Oral B12 melts (made by same company as Xylimelts)

### Inspire Consults




1. Check diagnosis of sleep apnea: AHI, (must be btw 15-65 w/ <25% central apneas) date of sleep study (should be in last 3 years). Ask previous nasal, palate, tonsil surgeries. Still having daytime fatigue. Check social hx: work history/driving problems. Ask about heart failure/afib
2. Patients must be >21yo. BMI<32
3. Check CPAP usage: <4 hours/<5days tolerated and reasons for poor tolerance (claustrophobia etc).
4. Contraindications: Pts w/ neuromuscular disorders or those who can’t operate the remote at night. Pregnant pts. Pts w/ complete concentric collapse of the soft palate of sleep endoscopy

### Thyroid Nodules




1. Nodules incidentally found on imaging

   
   1. Should always be confirmed by Thyroid & Cervical U/S
   2. Nodules >1cm seen on PET scans that are confirmed on thyroid U/S should get an FNA
2. Initial workup of palpable or incidentally found nodules

   
   1. \*\*TSH \*\*\[Free T<sub>4</sub>\] and \*\*Ultrasound \*\*
   2. **Normal or high TSH** → no need for reuptake radionuclide cscan
   3. **Low** TSH → get a Iodine<sup>123</sup> or Technetium<sup>99</sup> reuptake scan

      
      1. "Hot Nodule" → evaluate for hyperthyroidism
      2. "Cold Nodules" have a 5% risk of cancer and should get an ultrasound
3. Multiple nodules? Evaluate each one separately.

   
   1. If TSH low or normal. Get I<sup>123</sup> scan to see if there are autonomous nodules
   2. FNA iso or nonfunctioning nodules.
4. FNA

   
   1. Don't bother if its completely cystic
   2. Perform FNA if nodule is (A) >2cm \*\* or \*\*(B)  >1cm + suspicious features
   3. Suspicious Ultrasound features (70% chance of malignancy)

      
      1. \*\*<u>Hypo</u>\*\*echoic - think hypOH DEAR ITS CANCER
         * partially cystic and iso/hyperechoic are less worrying features: perform FNA if >1.5cm
      2. Microcalcification or rim calcifications
      3. Increased central vascularity
      4. Tall than wide (think a Cachetic patient) = bad. Wider than tall (fat person) = good
      5. Irregular margins

#### Bethesda system - Interpreting Results


4\. Malignant (99% risk) & suspicious for malignancy (70% risk)



1. Go to Surgery
2. Indeterminate cytology - Two types

   
   1. Follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm or Hurthle Cell (25% risk of malignancy)
      * Pretty much all of these are surgically excised. Affirma to supplement decision making
   2. FLUS (follicular lesion of unknown significance) or Atypia of undetermined significance — 14% risk
      * Can observe or excise.  Affirma test can help you rule out malignancy
   3. Surgery: if excision is planned - do a lobectomy unless there are reasons in the history that make us more suspicious for malignancy
3. Nondiagnostic—(around 1-4% risk):

   
   1. repeat U/S guided FNA. Most people wait \~3months but should repeat sooner if there are concerning U/S findings
   2. Can excise if suspicious u/s findings or if its growth >20% in 2 directions
4. Benign — 2.5% risk

   
   1. Follow up these patients
      * Suspicious U/S features: repeat U/S & FNA within 12 months
      * Otherwise repeat U/S in 12-24months and FNA if (a) growth >20% in 2 directions or (b) nodule develops suspicious features
5. You can stop following any nodule that's had two benign cytology results. Its benign, get over it

<!-- -->


5\. Follow Up



1. Nodules that met criteria for FNA but were benign: see above
2. Nodules that did not meet criteria for FNA
3. repeat U/S in 12-24months (you don't need to follow spongiform or purely cyst nodules)
4. Nodules that are >4cm or cause compressive symptoms can be surgically removed

#### Improving Voice Outcomes after Thyroid Surgery – Clinical Practice Guideline

* Preoperative: Guidelines recommend documentation of voice and performing a FOE prior to Thyroid surgery on EVERY patient. Discuss risk of thyroid surgery to voice. Discuss findings of FOE w/ anesthesia.
* Perioperative: should identify RLN and SLN. Intraop nerve monitoring is optional. No opinion on decadron
* Postop: should perform FOE on patients w/ voice change post op. If abnormal voice or VF mobility abnormality, patients should f/u with SLP

### Adult Neck Mass – Clinical Practice Guideline

* Don’t routinely give antibiotics unless other signs of infection exist
* Suspicious if: present for >2 weeks w/o change in size <u>or</u> if on exam mass is (1) fixed to adjacent structure (2) firm (3) >1.5cm or (4) has ulceration of overlying skin <u>or</u> history highly suspicious

  
  1. In these patients, do targeted physical exam (FOE etc)
  2. Strongly recommend CT neck (U/S or MRI ok) or performing an FNA on these suspicious neck masses

     
     1. FNA should be done INSTEAD of an open biopsy
     2. Cystic masses: don’t assume that they are benign
  3. If testing is negative:

     
     1. Can either with open biopsy (should <u>always</u> be done with a direct laryngoscopy)
     2. Or could do additional testing (CBC, ANA, SSA/SSB, ESR, TSH, PTH, EBV,CMV, PPD, Bartonella, Thyroid U/S, CT chest /w contrast, Thyroglobulin FNA-needle wash assay

### Nerve Sheath Tumors

#### Paragangliomas (Glomus tumors)

Glomus Jugulare: supplied by ascending pharyngeal a.

Glomus Tympanicum: arise from Jacobson’s nerve (CNIX)

Carotid Body: MC in H&N: internal carotid posterior and external carotid anteriorly (Lyre sign)

Vagal paraganglioma: Displaces carotid anteriorly and medially

### Salivary Glands

Innervation:

\-Sup. Salivary nuc → GSPN (pregang. parasymp.) \[CN7\] →pterygopalatine ganglion → lacrimal

\-Inf. Salivary nuc → Lesser petrosal \[CN9\] → Otic ganglion → auriculotemporal n. → parotid

\-Sup. Salivary nuc → Corda Tympani \[CN7\] → Submandibular ganglion → submandibular gland

### Melanoma

* Ask about:

  
  1. Sunlight exposure, history of skin burns, family history (xeroderma pigmentosum, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome)
* Presents as a mole-like growth with "ABCD" (ABCD is diagnostic not prognostic )

  
  1. Asymmetry, Borders are irregular. Color is not uniform. Diameter > 6 mm.
* Workup:

  
  1. Ideally: excisional biopsy w/ 1-2mm narrow margins. If too large, can do punch biopsy however this is subject to sampling error so if negative, strongly consider repeating. This will give you information to perform the wide local excision later.
  2. Patients with:
  3. Stage IB or higher: should get a CXR (r/o lung mets) LDH (eval for liver mets)
  4. Palpable LNs or imaging findings for enlarged LNs: get U/S guided FNA to eval for metastatic LN disease
  5. Stage III disease: some advocate for CT C/A/P to look for distant mets (CT chest is most important)
  6. Stage IV disease: PET-CT C/A/P, MRI head, refer for clinical trials
* Prognosis depends on variant: worse with ↑Breslow Depth, ulceration, M>F, and Head/Neck location

  
  1. Occiput and cheek most common sites of H&N
* Markers

  
  1. HMB-45 (specific). S-100 sensitive. Melan A. MART-1
* Variants include

  
  1. Superficial spreading—most common subtype; dominant early radial growth results in good prognosis.
  2. Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM)—lentiginous proliferation (radial growth); best prognosis. Associated with sun-exposed skin and the elderly
  3. Nodular—blue/blackish, looks like hemangiomaearly vertical growth; poor prognosis
  4. Acral lentiginous—arises on the palms or soles, often in dark-skinned individuals; not related to UV light exposure
  5. Desmoplastic-Neurotropic Melanoma (DM): often are amelanotic. High rate of recurrence
* Clark levels: <u>only useful for prognosis in T1 lesions.</u>

  
  1. **epidermis** only = stage I.
  2. **Into papillary** dermis = II.
  3. **All of papillary** dermis =III.
  4. Invades **reticular** dermis = IV.
  5. Into **subcutaneous** tissue: V
* Melanoma TNM Staging

|    | N0 | N1 |
|----|----|----|
| T1a | IA | III |
| T1b | IB | III |
| T2a | IB | III |
| T2b | IIA | III |
| T3a | IIA | III |
| T3b | IIB | III |
| T4a | IIB | III |
| T4b | IIC | III |

Survival: T1 95%, T2 80-95%, T3:40-85%. T4:10-30%

* Treatment

  
  1. Surgical margins

> Tis = 0.5mm margin
>
> T1 (<1mm) = 1cm margin.
>
> T2 (1-2mm): do 1-2cm margin
>
> T3+ (>2mm): do 2cm


2\. T2/T3/T4



1. Adjuvant: may consider interferon alpha 2b (Stage III+)
2. N0 neck: consider sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB). Especially if
   * <60 yo especially for tumors w/o ulceration, Ulceration, High mitotic rate, Angiolymphatic invasion, Clark level IV
3. N1-N3: Neck dissection

   
   1. Superficial parotidectomy + MRND if primary location is: anterior/lateral scalp, temple, lateral forehead, lateral cheek , ear (basically anything anterior to the plane of the EACs)
   2. Level II-V neck dissection: If primary is scalp/occiput posterior to the coronal plane of the EACs.
4. Special considerations:

   
   1. Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) — tends to have subclinical spread (often has positive margins). After resection, take a circumferential "square" margin (Anderson et al. Johnson et al.)
5. Chemo:

   
   1. Interferon alpha-2b — use for stage III, consider for T2+ lesions. Can cause hepatic and cardiac toxicity.
   2. Dacarbazine (DTIC) — stage IV

* Sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) w/ pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy

  
  1. 2-4 hours preop, patients get radioactive colloid into melanoma. Inject methylene blue into melanoma (dermis). Dissect out the hottest radiactive node and all other nodes that are above 10% of the cpm value of the hottest node.

## Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

#### Prognosis by Stage

> Stage 0 —99%
>
> Stage 1 — 90-92%
>
> Stage 2 — 75-85%
>
> Stage 3 — 50%
>
> Stage 4 — 25-35%

#### 

#### Who gets chemotherapy

* Nasopharyngeal CA: Stage III-IV, some Stage II
* Unresectable H&N Ca
* Laryngeal CA: induction cisplatin/5-FU for organ preservation
* Unknown Primary – patients with N2,N3 disease
* **Patients with positive margins or lymph nodes that have ECS**

#### 

#### Who gets radiation therapy to neck

* Patients with N1 disease + extracapsular spread
* Patients with N2-3 disease

#### 

#### Who gets a neck dissection:

Classic training is that if risk of spread to lymph nodes is >15-25%, should do neck dissection

**N0 disease in:**

* Oral Cavity - I - III
* Oropharynx - II - IV
* Hypopharynx/Larynx - II-IV, VI when appropriate
* Subglottic - II-IV and VI

### 

### Oral Cavity CA

**Management**

* Excision w/ reconstruction. Tumors <2cm can be approached transorally

  
  1. Mandible: Abutting periosteum - can get away with a marginal mandibulectomy. Invasion of mandible - need a segmental resection
* N0 necks: elective ipsi/bilateral (b/l if midline) level I-III (Can avoid neck dissection in T1/2 N0 lower lips).
* N1+ neck: selective I-III ND.
* RT if positive nodes. Chemotherapy if adverse features (positive margins, ECS on LNs)

### Oropharyngeal CA

**Sites**:

* Tonsil: MC, aggressive, high risk of occult LN spread
* Base of tongue: also aggressive w/ high rates of LN spread
* Posterior pharyngeal wall and soft palate = less aggressive

> **Management**

T1-T2: excision vs primary XRT.

N0: XRT or elective unilateral or bilateral ND levels II-IV.

N1: XRT selective ND II-IV.

N2-3: Chemorads + selective ND

T3-T4: typically treated with radiation

### Laryngeal CA

#### Premalignant Glottic Lesions




1. Hyperplasia/Hyperkeratosis - <u>not a risk for malignancy</u>
2. Dysplasia

   
   1. Severe dysplasia/Carcinoma in situ- risk is 15-25%
   2. CIS has features of malignancy but <u>not invaded beyond basement membrane</u>
3. Excisions

   
   1. Microflap excision: Dissects superficial lamina propria and <u>spares vocal ligament</u>

#### Hypopharyngeal CA




1. Hypopharynx: Level of hyoid bone to the cricopharyngeus behind the larynx
2. **Piriform sinus** is most common location

   
   1. Post-cricoid region: think plummer-vinson syndrome
3. Most are diagnosed at advanced stage

   
   1. Hypopharynx may have skip lesions
4. Management

   
   1. T1, some T2, N0 - partial laryngopharygectomy
   2. Always do Level II-IV neck dissection even in N0 disease
5. Techniques

   
   1. **Partial laryngopharyngectomy**
      * For T1 (some T2) piriform sinus cancer
      * Must involve **medial wall** and be **1.5cm away from apex**
   2. **Lateral + suprahyoid pharyngectomy**
      * For <u>posterior</u> cricopharyngeal wall CA
   3. Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy
      * For advance CA and <u>post-cricoid</u> CA
   4. For these, need reconstruction with tension-free closure.

#### LARYNGEAL




1. Sites

   
   1. **Supraglottis**: High rate of note metastasis. Typically to bilateral II-IV
   2. **Glottis**: Most common site in larynx
      * Less spread due to barriers (vocal ligament, thyroglottic ligament)
      * Anterior commissure - <u>no inner perichondrium</u> allows for anterior spread to thyroid cartilage
   3. **Subglottic**: Rare, poor prognosis
2. Treatments

   
   1. Laser surgery
      * Ideal for T1 glottic or supraglottic SCCA. Risk of scarring
      * **Anterior commissure involvement** - associated with high recurrence rates
   2. Surgery
      * Cordectomy—Indication: T1 glottic cancer restricted to <u>middle 1/3 of vocal fold</u>
      * Conservative/Function Laryngectomies:
        * Contraindication to partial laryngectomies is poor pulmonary function
        * Vertical partial laryngectomy (Hemi laryngectomy)
          * high risk of aspiration, must have really go pulmonary function
          * Can decrease risk by **turning to operated side** and performing a **chin tuck**
          * T1/T2 glottic CA that doesn't extend beyond 1/3 of opposite cord or involve posterior commissure
        * Supraglottic partial laryngectomy (Horizontal Hemi-laryngectomy)
          * For **T1/T2 *supraglottic* tumors**
          * preservation of both true vocal cords and arytenoids - preserves voice
          * Disadvantage: needs initial trach, increased aspiration risk as SLN is taken
        * Supracricoid partial laryngectomy
          * Must preserve <u>one functional cricoarytenoid unit</u> (arytenoid, cricoid and hyoid and associated musculature, plus the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerve)
          * Resects supraglottis plus vocal fold, thyroid cartilage, and paraglottic space
          * **Select T3/T3 supraglottic/glottic CA** - must not have **arytenoid fixation**
        * Open partial laryngectomy: Resects anterior commissure for select cases
        * **Contraindications**:
          * Cartilage invasion, **VF fixation**, interarytenoid involvement, tongue base involvement, poor performance status
      * Total laryngectomy:
        * With addition of pharyngeal structures such as piriform sinus or laryngeal pharyngeal wall if needed
   3. Radiation: Used for T1/T2 lesions
   4. Neck Dissections
      * Hypopharyngeal: Yes starting at T1 (With T2 or N1, should also do Level VI)
      * Supraglottic: yes for T1 N0

## 

## Post- H&N Cancer Treatment Follow-up Guide:

* Interval H&P w/ fiberoptic or mirror exam:

  
  1. Year 1: q1-3months.
  2. Year 2: q2-6months
  3. Year 3-5:q4-8months
  4. After 5years: q1year
* Get post-therapy (surgery or XRT) CT vs PET-CT 2-3 months (for most ppl – can probs avoid in T1/T2 glottic CA since It only picks up 7-8mm lesions and FOE is more sensitive)
* Check CXR and thyroid function tests q6-12 months
* Evals: SLP, dental, and nutrition evals as needed

## Head & Neck – OR Guide

### Dr. Tracy’s Radial Forearm Free Flap

**Raising the flap**

Prep:

Shave arm

Prep arm, shoulder, chest with Chloraprep while someone holds the arm, and prep the head and neck in the usual fashion

Tuck half sheet covered with towels under the flank. Arm needs to rest on arm board, place sterile drape on arm board.

Place a towel around the armpit and use Edna to clip it. Then, wrap a sponge around the thumb to supinate the forearm and clip the sponge to the arm board with an Edna.

Then cover the arm with towel to keep sterile.

Dr. Tracy will then wrap the arm with an elastic wrap to drain it off its venous supply. Then the tourniquet will be applied as a setting of 250 and a timer for 1 hour starts.

Begin by incising the lateral aspect of the skin paddle to find the Cephalic vein which is preserved and follow it all the way up to the antecubital fossa. Next use forceps to find the vascular pedicle then you can raise the flap on the contralateral side and isolate and tie off the vascular pedicle and start lifting the flap

### Dr. O’Leary’s Thyroidectomy

Prep:

Laryngeal nerve monitoring tube is needed and the Medtronic NIM monitor. No paralytics, and needs antibiotics. Watch anesthesia’s glidescope to ensure that the blue stripe is adjacent to the vocal cords. Place the gel ax roll as the shoulder roll and recheck the tube placement with the glidescope. Attach the nerve monitor consul at the head of the bed and tape it in place. Ensure that the nerve monitor is working appropriately by tapping in the neck. Mark the neck along a nerve crease if possible 2-3 cm above the sternal notch. Inject with 1% lidocaine with epi. Prep with betadine.

### Dr. Dhingra’s Thyroidectomy

Inject incision in preop.

Make generous incision 2 inches above the sternum then make the incision down past the platysma on both sides and use the Bovie to develop yourself sub-platysmal flaps. Use your finger as a come hither motion to get them going and work a free edge. Go down to the sternum on the inferior flap. Go up to the cricoid/thyroid notch superiorly.

Then travel down midline kind of like you would do with a trach. Use kelly’s to present the midline fascia for someone to divide with the bovie.

Keep going making sure you’re a midline until you come down to the thyroid. Be careful inferiorly because there is a plexus of vessels and become very vascular. Here use the ligasure to make sure you don’t make anything bleed.

Once you found the thyroid then you want to work the sternothyroid off the thyroid to develop the lateral edge of the thyroid. To do this, get two peanuts: one using to retract the thyroid towards you and the other to push on the undersurface of the sternothyroid to elevate it off. Once you have enough of an edge, ask for the lady finger for someone to retract. Once you’ve developed the lateral edge, keep doing it up towards the superior pole. Here there are a lot of vessels so be sure to use the Ligasure.

This is the part to pay attention to: developing the superior pole is the one of three or four critical steps. You should not look for the superior laryngeal nerve necessarily but you should be cognizant of the cricothyroid muscle.

Once you have freed the superior pole you can develop the middle a little bit more but don’t get too deep/posterior. This is when you have to check to see where your current laryngeal nerve is remember the different landmarks.




1. Located in simon's triangle: trachea, carotid, and inferior lobe.
2. RLN is deep to berry's ligament
3. Tubercle of Zuckerkandl: RLN is medial to it. Superior thyroid is superior to it
4. Left RLN is more medial than right RLN. Left RLN is reliably deep to inferior thyroid a
5. Superior Parathyroid is posterior to RLN. Inferior parathyroid is anterior to RLN

In reality you’re going to use a snit forcep spreading in the direction of the nerve and using the stimulator. Once you found it follow superiorly and inferiorly see that you are confident of the plane typically people follow it all the way into its insertion.

Once you’ve done that you can free the rest of the middle and inferior pole of the thyroid and of the trachea. You can do this relatively quickly as the nerve is protected. Once the thyroid only attached to the trachea, use a Kelly and spread along the trachea in the midline superior to inferior (you can use a bovie to take it off the trachea as well as the plane is pretty well developed). Then you can transect half of it and do the otherside. Dump some thrombin soaked Gelfoam into the resected area close the straps with 3-0 Vicryl. Close the platysma with 4-0 Vicryl and close the wound with a subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl.

### Dr Wein Thyroidectomy

Similar set up to Dhingra’s. When you lift the upper subplatysmal flap, roll skin over a wet 4x8 gauze and suture to mandible with 2-0 silk to retract it. Use 3 lone stars on lower flap. Split the straps. Free the middle of the thyroid. Use middle finger on gauze to retract thyroid towards you. Use a ladyfinger to retract straps. Bipolar through fascia. When you approach superior pole, hug gland. Dr Wein doesn’t necessarily go hunting for the nerve

### Dr Wein INSPIRE Hypoglossal Nerve Implants

**Set Up:**

* Patient rotated 180. Tube taped to the left
* Place shoulder roll. Tuck right arm. <u>Leave mouth open</u>
* NIM Monitor (NIM 3.0): 3 lead setup:

  
  1. Leads 1 & 2 go into tongue (include=blue, exclude=red)
  2. Lead 3 (purple) goes into marginal mandibular

<img src="media/image29.png" style="width:3.68368in;height:1.27878in" />

Figure 11: INSPIRE Implant Training, 2016

**Incisions:**

Neck: 4-6cm starting from anterior aspect of submandibular gland to \~1cm from midline.

Mark EJ, SMG, midline, hyoid, mandible

Implant Pocket: 5cm inferior to clavicle. 5.5cm in length. Between deltopectoral groove & sternum

Sensor: Use inferolateral margin of pec (should be 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space)

<img src="media/image30.png" style="width:2.25694in;height:1.55625in" /> 4-5cm incision lateral to nipple line

**Prep**

* Betadine from upper lip to mid abdomen. As far lateral as you can go to just past midline
* 1020 drape just above mandible (so tongue is visible)
* Drap off the rest. Then place ioban from superior to inferior.
* Split drape: drap up to head. Then half-drape around head & top of 1000 drape (allow tongue to still be visible

**Steps:**

> **Neck**: Incision through past platysma. Watch out for marginal mandibular (its just under platysma). Dissect to find mylohyoid/digastric tendon junction. If you first find the ant. belly of digastric, follow it posteriorly to digastric tendon. Then tunnel under DG tendon to free the entire length of posterior margin of mylohyoid. Retract mylohyoid anteriorly. This exposes the Ranine vein and the hypoglossal nerve.
>
> Isolate nerve fibers of hypoglossal nerve. Use bipolar NIM electrode to determine inclusion (GGh, GGo, T/V)/exclusion (HG/SG) fibers. Use vessel loop to help retract nerve to pass stimulator cuff around inclusion fibers
>
> Pass stimulator under digastric tendon then tie stimulation lead to anterior belly of digastric. Pack w/ baci-soaked gauze
>
> **Implant Pocket**: Incision down to but not through pec major fascia. Dissect pocket inferiorly to about 6cm deep
>
> Throw 2 silk sutures on medial edge of incision one 1cm superior to the other (vertical plane)
>
> **Sensor lead**: Incision on 5th intercostal space. Serratus fibers = most superficial running lateral to medial (inserting on ribs). External intercostals: run superior/lateral to inferior/medial (looks like packing tape). Make incision on medial aspect of incision through ext intercostals and dissect through until internal intercostals (running superior/medial to inferior/lateral) are seen.
>
> Use malleable to dissect plane btw ext & int intercostals (medially between ribs). Insert electrode. Fix sensor to ext intercostals w/ 4x 3-0 silk on RB-1
>
> **Tunnels:** Use tunneling shaft from neck incision to implant incision (avoid ext jugular) in the subplatysmal plane. Then tunnel from implant incision above pectoralis to sensor lead incision. Pass sensor leads from neck and chest sensors to implant. Put leads into implant. Screw in (press down and rotate for 4 clicks). Tie implant to pocket with 2-0 silks
>
> Close: 4-0 or 3-0 vicyrl for deeps. 5-0 monocyrl for superficial. Wash incision. Steri-stripes (perpendicular along incision than 3 parallel to incision to hide any blood stains. Unmarked 4x8 Gauze over incision taped down with Medipore tape
>
> **Post-op**
>
> No antibiotics
>
> Pain medication
>
> Give post-INSPIRE d/c instructions
>
> Get <u>Lateral Neck and CXR in PACU. Make sure patient has no PTX</u>

## Head & Neck – Post-op Guide

### Dr. Wein’s patients

* Always change dressing on rounds, replace Velcro trach ties, clean any dried blood/secretions etc. Take pride in their appearance.
* You don’t require permission to pull JP/Channel drains if their output has dropped off. Just use common sense
* post-op follow up appointments should be 10-14 days for patients who will be waiting on pathology results
* Be active in communication with the family.

### Dr. O’Leary’s patients

* Typically removes drains after 3 shifts where output is <20cc. Check before removing any drains

### Laryngectomy patients

* Diet: NPO
* Nursing:

  
  1. humidified air at all times (unless HME in place)
  2. keep laryngectomy tube in place, clean once daily
  3. suction laryngectomy stoma as needed for secretions
  4. apply bacitracin ointment to chest and neck twice daily
  5. sign above bed saying patient cannot be intubated from above
  6. Leave trach collar loose fitting ( 2 fingerbreadths distance from neck)
  7. If stoma vent is dislodged, it is NOT an airway emergency; gently place back into stoma
* Rounds: **<u>check for crusting in the stoma</u>** – any exposed cartilage? In radiated patients, look out for possible fistula formation (tube feeds coming out neck)

### Thyroidectomy patients

* Check PTH and iCa2+ post-op in PACU. If PTH abnormal, check iCa2+ q4-6hours. If normal, recheck iCa2+ q8hrs.
* levothyroxine: according to endocrine, **levothyroxine dose in mcg = 1.7xpt’s weight (kg)**
* If hypocalcemic – replete Ca2+ (see electrolyte section)

### Tracheostomy Tube Placement

* Post op CXR
* As RT to get a spare trach (plus size smaller) in the room. Make sure fresh inner cannulas, trach ties are in the room
* Make sure nursing has suctioning set-up
* Order routine trach care (suctioning PRN, humidified air)

First trach change:

* Done on POD5-7. Longer if you expect trach change to be difficult: deep neck, high lung compliance (aka high PEEP requirement).
* **Before trach change**: ask RT to put new trachs at bedside and ask the RN to verify the correct type is there. Also ask the RN to give some pain medication just before change.
* **Need**: shoulder roll, headlight, new trach, 10cc syringe, lube, suture scissors, suction set up in room, flexible ‘chimney’ suction, yankeur suction, 4x4 gauze w/ saline, Velcro trach tie, allvyn dressing (prn)
* After 1<sup>st</sup> trach change: RT can change the trach

### Specific Complications and their management

#### Chyle Leak:

If suspected, collect from JP and send for triglycerides, chylomicrons. Also get serum triglycerides. Positive if TG >100mg/dL if TG(in JP) > TG serum or if there are any chylomicrons

Low output: <500cc/day:

\-octreotide 100 𝜇g SC Q8 or 3-6mg IV qdaily. Can cause HTN and gallstones.

\-Medium chain triglyceride diet \[For tube feeds switch to Portagen\]

High output >500cc/day: typically need to go to OR.
