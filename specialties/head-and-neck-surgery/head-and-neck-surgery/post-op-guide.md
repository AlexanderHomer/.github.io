Dr. Wein's patients



- 

Always change dressing on rounds, replace Velcro trach ties,
clean any dried blood/secretions etc. Take pride in their
appearance.



- 

You don't require permission to pull JP/Channel drains if their
output has dropped off. Just use common sense

who will be waiting on pathology results

Be active in communication with the family.

### 
Laryngectomy



- 

Diet: NPO



- 

Nursing:



- 

humidified air at all times (unless HME in place)



- 

keep laryngectomy tube in place, clean once daily



- 

suction laryngectomy stoma as needed for secretions



- 

apply bacitracin ointment to chest and neck twice daily



- 

sign above bed saying patient cannot be intubated from
above



- 

Leave trach collar loose fitting ( 2 fingerbreadths distance from
neck)



- 

If stoma vent is dislodged, it is NOT an airway emergency; gently
place back into stoma



- 

Rounds: **check for crusting in the stoma** --
any exposed cartilage? In radiated patients, look out for possible
fistula formation (tube feeds coming out neck)




### 
Thyroidectomy



- 

Check PTH and iCa2+ post-op in PACU. If PTH abnormal, check iCa2+
q4-6hours. If normal, recheck iCa2+ q8hrs.



- 

levothyroxine: according to endocrine, **levothyroxine dose
in mcg = 1.7xpt's weight (kg)**



- 

If hypocalcemic -- replete Ca2+ (see electrolyte section)




### 
Tracheostomy
Tube Placement



- 

Post op CXR



- 

As RT to get a spare trach (plus size smaller) in the room. Make
sure fresh inner cannulas, trach ties are in the room



- 

Make sure nursing has suctioning set-up



- 

Order routine trach care (suctioning PRN, humidified
air)





First trach change:



- 

Done on POD5-7. Longer if you expect trach change to be
difficult: deep neck, high lung compliance (aka high PEEP
requirement).



- 

**Before trach change**: ask RT to put new trachs at
bedside and ask the RN to verify the correct type is there. Also ask the
RN to give some pain medication just before change.



- 

**Need**: shoulder roll, headlight, new trach, 10cc
syringe, lube, suture scissors, suction set up in room, flexible
'chimney' suction, yankeur suction, 4x4 gauze w/ saline, Velcro trach
tie, allvyn dressing (prn)

After 1^st^ trach change: RT can change the
trach




### 
Specific Complications and their management


#### 
Chyle Leak:



If suspected, collect from JP and send for triglycerides,
chylomicrons. Also get serum triglycerides. Positive if TG \>100mg/dL
if TG(in JP) \> TG serum or if there are any chylomicrons



Low output: \500cc/day: typically need to go to OR.
