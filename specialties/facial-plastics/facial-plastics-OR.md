* Use Kay scissors (not curved iris scissors to exposure the cartilage all the way up to the antihelix.
* Develop it posteriorly as well.
* Use a 30G needle around the edge of the **conchal** bowl to demonstrate where the extent of your dissection should be and mark it with a marking pen.
* Use a 15 blade to release the cartilage in a C shaped incision.
* Make the incision as wide and big as possible.
* Dissect the reverse side of the cartilage with a pair of converse scissors.

## Lee – Sentinel lymph node biopsy

**YOU NEED**: **NeoProbe** (to find where the LN are), **30 gauge** needle (short needle is OK), methylene blue (at least 1mL), and NIM monitor.

* The patient will have gone to radiology and had a **lymphoscintography** prior to coming to the pre-operative area.
* Likely, radiology will have put an “X” or two over the area(s) that have lit up on their scan.
* They will also provide a paper print out of the areas that “lit up;” this should be in an envelope attached to the patient chart in pre-op.
* Based on where those “X”’s are (and thus where the sentinel lymph nodes are most likely to be), you and Dr. Lee will decide what proper nerve monitoring will need to occur 
  * ie: facial nerve monitoring for an intra-parotid LN vs. marginal mandibular for a neck LN, for example.

Often the sentinel lymph node biopsy will be part of a larger procedure, but these are the main steps for the SLNB:

* Use the **NeoProbe** to locate the lymph nodes that activate the highest; usually near the pre-marked **Xs**. \n The proper LN should register in/around 180–200, with all the surrounding areas registering in at significantly lower values (ie: 40–50).
* With this info, decide on the proper nerve monitoring, and set up the NIM.
* Go to the primary lesion. Inject methylene blue with the 30 gauge needle circumferentially. This MUST be in the dermal plane, as that’s where the lymphatics are.
  * You should see the methylene blue splay underneath the skin.
* Inject, prep, drape. This is generally not a full neck dissection. \n This will usually be a 2–3cm incision, dissect to find the LN using the NeoProbe to check on location, and find the LN.
* Find the LN. Note, this may NOT appear like a pathologic LN. \n This may be a subcentimeter LN that has some slight hypervascularity/blue tint.
* Test the LN on the back table.
  * If you have the right LN, the **NeoProbe** should register at the same level as before.
  * Test the bed in which the LN came from.
  * The surrounding areas should not register more than 20% of the original high-registering value (some people say 10% of highest value).
  * If it does, there are more LN to get.
* Close.


## Lee – Skin Grafting

* Prep out the thigh (usually right thigh) using Chlorhexidine. Try to find an area of the thigh that is most flat and without skin lesions. Drape using an upside down half sheet. Place a folded blue towel with a clamp on it over the prepped thigh. This ultimately gets covered with the over-drape, but the blue towel and clamp makes it easy to find when you’re ready to take the skin graft.
* When it’s time, feel the clamp, cut out the area with scissors. Staple the edges of the over-drape down.
* Measure out the skin graft (extra 1-2 cm in both directions). Rub mineral oil over the thigh. We use mineral oil because (1) it will not become rancid and (2) it smooths the area for easy skin graft harvesting.
* Preparing the skin graft blade: for STSG, Dr. Lee likes to set it somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3 inches. You should be able to fit a flat 15-blade between the blade and the machine; this will give you a good split thickness skin graft width if you can’t remember 0.2–0.3 or if you’re using a different machine.
* Choose the width gauge that is roughly 1–2cm larger than what you need.
* Place the skin graft machine on the thigh at an angle dictated by the side piece (there is a slight angle to the width gauge; roughly 20–30 degrees). Press relatively firmly and push forward. Use DeBakey’s to grasp the skin graft.
* Again, cut the graft so it is roughly 1–2cm longer than what you think you need. You do NOT need to mesh the graft. You will cut a few drainage holes in it once the graft is attached. You will likely bolster it down with cotton dipped in mineral oil wrapped in Xeroform, held down by silk ties. The skin graft site will be covered by a large **Allevyn** dressing, which stays there for one week.


## Lee – Post Mohs Reconstruction

### Flap Types

* **Pivotal**

  
  1. Rotation: eg cervicofacial advancement, O-to-Z
  2. Transpositional: eg bilobed and rhombic
  3. Interpolation: base of flap bridges over tissue: eg paramedian
  4. Island: eg V-to-Y island flap
* **Advancement**

  
  1. Unipedicle. Eg mesolabial
  2. Bilobed advancement
  3. V-to-Y advancement flap

### BEST LOCAL FLAP FOR LOCATION

* **SCALP:** STSG or rotation flapsA. >6cm + partial thickness: STSGB. <6cm: Consider O-T or O-Z flaps (this is because two rotation flaps are used in OT & OZ flaps: Arc of scalp should be 4 times the diameter of defect)
* **FOREHEAD**
  * Midline: Can close primarily in a vertical orientation (<1cm).**Dissect in subgaleal plane.**
  * Paramedian/Lateral: do bilateral advancement flaps. Dissect in superficial plane to avoid supratrochlear/supraorbital nerves
* **MEDIAL CHEEK**
  * Above Ala: Transposition flaps (rhomboid) with lines in the **melolabial**/labial mandibular creases
  * At or below level of ala: V-to-Y island flap (imagine the defect is the base of a triangle and that the other two sides of the triangle close together).

    
    1. Width of skin triangle = wide of defect at widest point. Have the length be TWICE length of defect. Have triangle in the direction of the **mesolabial** groove.
    2. Undermine 2 cm in all directions.
    3. Cut all three limbs of triangle. Blood supply is from deep (at least 1/3 of skin island must have deep attachments. Cut defect to fit graft)
* **LATERAL CHEEK**
  * Small defects: transposition flap (rhomboid).
  * Large defects: rotation advancement flap (cervicofacial advancement)
* **LIP**
  * Central lip/philtrum: bilateral advancement flap with incision on vermillion border
  * Lateral lip: rotation flap. Not from medial cheek to maintain **melolabial** crease
* **NOSE**
  * Anterior aspect of alar groove: island pedicle flap
  * Nasal tip or nasal dorsum/sidewall: bilobed flap (max for 1–1.5cm defects)
