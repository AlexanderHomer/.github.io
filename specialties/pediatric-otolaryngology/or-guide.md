Otolaryngology -- OR guide


### 
Rigid
Bronchoscopy (Scott or Vecchiotti)



**Set up:**



- 

Check last op note to see what size laryngoscope, bronch, and ETT
sizes were used



- 

On table for bronch:



- 

**Parson's Laryngoscope**: Age appropriate \[see
chart\]



- 

**Y-split light cable** (must be the one with a
straight light cable adapter on one side and the curved light prism for
the laryngoscope of the other end.



- 

**Bronchoscope** age appropriate \[check chart\]



- 

Connect the **rubber nipple, suction cover, bridge, and
light prism** (only in half way down so it doesn't obstruct the
endoscope)



- 

**0 degree endoscope**: pick the largest size that
will fit into the bronchoscope. **MAKE SURE IT FITS**.
**MAKE SURE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT** (sometimes they are
broken)



- 

**2 suctions:** A small shorter suction for the
larynx and a longer suction (one that fits through the bronch)



- 

**Camera**: connect to endoscope, focus and white
balance



- 

**Fred**



- 

**1% lidocaine**:



- 

**Calculate max dose for patient's weight**: 0.4 x
pt's weight (kg) = amount of 1% lidocaine in cc. \[eg 10kg child can have
4cc of 1%lidocaine\]



- 

draw up into a **non-luer lock 1cc syringe**
x 2. Put on a **14G angiocath** (orange tip)



- 

**Vocal fold spreader** + **sterile elastics +
A right angled probe**



- 

**A shoulder roll.**

[]{#_Toc139824222 .anchor}Flexible
bronchoscopy:



- 

Need the flexible bronchoscopy (XP size), probably pediatric size
(unless you're bronching an older child), flexible bronchoscopy Olympus
tower



- 

Place all of the following on a blue towel on top of the XP
towel:



- 

Lubrication on a separate blue towel



- 

FRED and green pad



- 

Swivel adapter -- should be in the drawer, but if not, get one
from anesthesia work room



- 

1% Lidocaine (plain), 1mL in a 5cc syringe with a 14G
angiocath



- 

Pieces for the flexible bronchoscope -- should also be in the
drawer, but these include the suction piece and the injector piece.
These need to click into place.



- 

Blue basin with sterile saline



- 

If he is performing BALs you will need:



- 

Luken's traps



- 

A few of the sterile 10cc saline syringes



- 

Have DL Bronch set up. Keep in room and don't break down after
use



- 

Have flex bronch set up (can keep in substerile room if space is
needed -- will use at end of case)



- 

Set-up:



- 

Start with DLB. Afterwards, rotate patient so he/she is a full
180 degrees around



- 

You have time as anesthesia places a femoral line.



- 

Make sure anesthesia has a second circuit that comes under bed to
a Christmas tree at the head of the bed.



- 

Remove tracheostomy tube and replace with an oral rae. Suture
this to the skin w/ silks like we do in free flaps



- 

Mark a right-side inframammary incision & inject w. lido w/
epi



- 

Mark an elliptical incision around trach stoma. Mark midline and
the clavicles



- 

Prep from upper lip to belly button all the way laterally to just
past midline



- 

Towel off (don't include mouth in sterile field) and staple to
skin (not on face). Use split from inferior to superior and then use
half drape superiorly (like Wein's INSPIRE patients) and then staple a
blue towel between rib incision and clavicle (just one edge so it can
flip upwards over the stoma when working on the ribs and flip back down
once you finish to keep it clean



- 

Make sure uncuffed oral rae tubes are on the sterile field (size
of trach + 2/3 sizes up).



- 

Be in preop area at least 15 minutes prior to
1^st^ case



- 

Update the pre-op paperwork. Sign the ticket to safety.



- 

Place post-op orders, and brief op note, but only if you have
time! Get the room ready first!



- 

Check the room to make sure equipment is ready!



- 

Ear tubes



- 

Balance microscope (make sure plugged in).



- 

Make sure 250 mm lens in place. Wipe lens with alcohol
swab



- 

2 Sheehey Silastic button collar tubes available



- 

Chairs on both sides of the OR table.



- 

Have speculum and loop curette wrapped in blue towel ready on OR
bed



- 

Tonsils and Adenoids



- 

Head drape (blue towel folded into triangle) on OR bed. Tape for
head drape



- 

Shoulder roll



- 

Settings:



- 

Spatula-tip bovie on 20/20.



- 

Suction cautery coag on 28 (cut on 20) & blend for
adenoids



- 

Head lights



- 

On mayo stand:



- 

appropriate size crowe-davis mouth gag.



- 

soft suction catheter and curved kelly clamp



- 

Allis clamp and herd elevator



- 

laryngeal mirror + fred



- 

pre-bend the suction cautery!



- 

For ear tubes, have your gloves on and be ready to push the
microscope toward the OR bed as soon as the patient is asleep!



- 

For tonsils and adenoids, have your headlight on by the time the
patient is intubated. Help anesthesia tape the tube down middle of
bottom lip. Be ready to turn the table 90 degrees to the right. Place
the head drape and shoulder roll. Have chair ready.



- 

Try to finish your op note when done



- 

Sign-out to the PICU resident if the patient is being admitted to
PICU post-op.




id="open-neck-cases-eg-thyroglossal-duct-cyst-vecchiotti"\>Open Neck
Cases eg thyroglossal duct cyst (Vecchiotti)

Dr. Vecchiotti's glove size: **7**



PREPPING - You need:



- 

"1000 drapes" cut in half. Mastisol. Betadine. Marking pen.
Alcohol swabs. 1% lido with 1:100,000 epi (use 0.5 % with 1:200,000 epi
if young infant, ask if in doubt) .



- 

2 sets of headlights





Have marking pen ready to pre-mark incision -- have alcohol swabs
ready if need to erase/remark. Apply mastisol around your operative
field. Place the 1000 drapes on all 4 sides. Do a wide prep with
betadine. **Put on headlight before you scrub.** Have
bipolar set on 10/10.



CLOSING -- in general:



- 

4.0 vicryl for deep layers; buried interrupted



- 

5.0 or 6.0 fast absorbing gut for skin; simple running



- 

5.0 monocryl if closing skin with subcuticular stitches



- 

Prolene if placing drain



- 

Bacitracin ointment (occasionally dermabond)





**Sistrunk (Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Excision)
Technique:** see article *Posterior Hyoid Space as Related to
Excision of the Thyroglossal Duct Cyst* John Maddalozzo, MD, FAAP,
FACS, Jeremy Alderfer, MD; Vikash Modi, MD *The Laryngoscope
2010*


### 
Cochlear
Implants (Vecchiotti)



**To confirm before patient enters room**



- 
**

Check the patient's ear in the pre-op area to r/o mucoid
effusion.






Make sure CPD have pulled the cochlear implant instruments kit (there
is a special kit for each CI manufacturer), the ear kit, an M&T kit,
the Paparella press (for tympmastoids) the Visao drill with a 6 cutting,
3 cutting, 2 coarse diamond and 1 fine diamond drill on the field (a 1.5
fine diamond off the field as well)



Make sure they have the PURPLE permanent marker on the field (it's
the only one that draws on the Ioban)



Make sure they have a NIM nerve stimulator (the one where you can
change the voltage) on the field



A big bag of saline and big bag of sterile water handing on the
irrigation machine (the one used for the microdebrider). Don't allow the
scrubs to open an actual microdebrider...for their sake.



Make sure the cochlear instruments have these templates (Cochlear
Corp)



Balance the microscope. Don't drape it yet.



![](../media/image18.jpeg)![](../media/image19.png)Call audiology and give them
the serial numbers for the cochlear implants



**Things to put on the non-sterile side table:**



M&T kit, mastisol, 1000 drapes cut in half (need 5-6), NIM
electrodes, tegederms cut in ½, a razor, alcohol prep pads,
lidocaine)



**Set up**



![](../media/image20.png)Bed rotated 180 degrees.
Leica microscope at head of bed, tower can be on the scrub side of
microscope, NIM monitor and suction on the scrub side by the feet.



Draw out the BTE template. Draw out the location of the implant using
the silicone template. This has to be above the temporal line and make
the angle that it sits \>45 degrees (Vecchiotti likes it more vertical
than usual) from the temporal line. Shave the hair by the proposed
implant site.



Draw a lazy S incision 0.5cm behind the post-auricular crease.



![](../media/image21.png)Place the NIM and curl the
leads before you stick the Tegaderm down. Test the monitor. Volume to
max, voltage at 0.8.



Put mastisol where the 1000 drapes will go and put the 1000 drapes
down.



**Evaluate the TM with the microscope before you
prep**.



Prep a wide area. Get the parts of the 1000 drapes that slip behind
each other. put the craniotomy drape (the one that collects fluid) on
the patient. Redraw template. Cut the ear out. Then put the Ioban from
posterior to anterior pulling the ear forward as you do. Redraw template
markings again. Have scrub drape the microscope and the chairs.



**Procedure**



15 blade for incision, carry down to the temporalis fascia. Raise
supraperiosteal flaps anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the EAC.



Create a palva flap -- use a bovie (if no contralateral implant
placed) down to the bone. Raise the flap with a Lempert periosteal
elevator to the spine of henle.



![](../media/image22.png)Do a cortical mastoidectomy,
focus on the corner where the tegmen and EAC meet. Use a #6 until you
hit Koerner septum, then switch to a #3 to expose the lateral
semicircular canal, incus buttress and the fossa incudes. The incus
points to the facial recess. Use the facial nerve stimulator to get an
idea where the facial nerve is, then take down the air cells on the EAC
(your gonna take corda) to get through the facial recess. Expose round
window. Drill part of your cochlostomy with a 1 diamond burr
anterior/inferior to round window until you are about to pop through it
then stop.



Use a freer to create your pocket (make it small/tight. He'll pimp
you on what is keeps the implant from moving. The answer is the
temporalis tendon blocks the anterior/inferior corner of the implant
from migrating) Put the metal implant template on a Kelly and use that
to dissect the pocket for a good fit. Use a pen to mark a line from the
metal template to the mastoid cavity and use a 3 cutting burr to drill a
well for the electrodes. Take some temporalis fascia for later



Irrigate the mastoid. Ask for blue towels to put around the sterile
area and change gloves. Open to the cochlear implant. Ask the nurses to
disconnect the bovie and the circulator to order the portable x-ray



Use the #1 diamond burr to finish your cochleostomy. Hold the implant
fin with AOS forceps and put the implant into the cochleostomy until you
hit the Silastic stopper. Then advance the electrodes, stop if you feel
resistance, until the white tabs line up. Pack the cochleostomy



Use non-compressed gelfoam to pack the mastoid. Close palva flap with
running 4-0 vicryl. Close deep layer with 4-0 vicyrl. Superficial with a
5-0 fast absorbing plain gut, use dermabond over that. Use a kerlex for
fluffs. Then do a mastoid dressing (with 2 kerlexs)



**Post-op Instructions**



Mastoid/glasscock dressing for 24 hours. Then glasscock dressing at
night until follow up



Keflex until f/u (give a refill on script)



HOB \>30 degrees. Sinus precautions. Dry ear precautions



Call for fevers, chills, drainage, persistent vertigo etc


### 
Botox injections to salivary glands - both MV & AS



- 
Call pedi ultrasound to make sure they're available and will be in the room at start of case

- 
x4 1cc syringes

- 
x4 yellow tip 27gauge needles

- 
x1 5cc syringe filled with sterile NS. Use 18gauge needle to dilute botox in the 5cc sterile NS.

- 
Draw 1cc into each of the 1cc syringes. Place 27gauge needles on the 4 1cc syringes

- 
Alcohol swabs to clean skin before injections

- 
Usually inject 1cc or 20 units/gland


### 
Dr Scott's OR Guide



For **Andrew Scott operative note** you need to
focus on FINDINGS: **+/- submucus cleft, Size of Tonsils, Size of
Adenoids, Electrocautery Settings.**



[]{#_Toc139824229 .anchor}Adenotonsillectomy
(Scott):



- 

Have shoulder roll and head drape ready



- 

Drape head, place shoulder roll after intubated and rotated 90
degrees away from anesthesia



- 

Place Crowe-Davis mouth gag, feel for submucus cleft
palate



- 

Place soft suction catheter through nasal cavity; place rolled
gauze between soft suction catheter and clamp to secure in place
(Vecchiotti does not use rolled gauze)



- 

Start with adenoidectomy- use microdebrider with the curved
blade. Get all the adenoids out before blood hits the suction machine
(this is Scott's gauge if you're doing it correctly)



- 

Pack with tonsil ball(s)



- 

Remove tonsils using Bovie electrocautery at setting of 20 and
20. Start more laterally than Vecchiotti (take the anterior pillar)
Cauterize the tonsillar fossa with suction electrocautery at setting of
20.



- 

Remove the tonsil balls, cauterize adenoid bed at setting of
28.



- 

Irrigate oral and nasal cavity with saline. (The correct way to
irrigate the nasal cavity is to place the bulb suction in the nostril,
squeeze, and gradually remove will still squeezing so irrigation gets on
the patient's face. Do not release the squeeze while in the nose, as
this could cause epistaxis and general annoyance.)



- 

Suction stomach with adult orogastric tube "Tummy time"



- 

Remove everything, you're done!




### 
Nasal endoscopy case/DCR in combo w/ ophtho - Scott



- 
Afrin-soaked pledgets

- 
4.0 zero degree scope (this can be obtained from airway cart, does not need to be sterile, i.e. don't need pedi FESS kit solely for the scope)

- 
lido w/ epi with yellow tip 27gauge needle

- 
4.0 Vicryl TF (if suturing stent in place)

- 
BMT kit usually adequate for equipment (alligator, Frazier tip suctions), also might need freer - unless planning for full DCR in which case FESS kit +/- drill (not sure which kind) may be necessary


### 
Butterfly
tympanoplasty -- Scott



Steps:



- 
inject canal. Make an incision on posterior tragus. Incise through the cartilage to anterior surface. Elevate anterior surface first. Then do posterior. Keep scissors bevel up (check what this means). KEEP the perichondrium on the cartilage

- 
just close incision with 2 interrupted sutures to prevent a tragal hematoma

- 
rim perforation. Then use cartilage, size it 2mm larger than perforation. Butterfly the cartilage with a #15 blade (circumferentially score it). The perichondrium will cause the edges to curl so it looks like a ear tube. Place it in the perforation.
