# Common Conditions

## OME - Clinical Practice Guidelines

* **Recurrent AOM:** 3 discrete episodes of AOM in 6months or 4 in past 12 months
  * **Recurrent AOM**: book for tympanostomy tube placement if OME seen on day of visit. **Patients >4yo should get an adenoidectomy with ear tubes.**
* **Chronic OME**: OME that persists for 3+ months
  * Always use pneumatic otoscopy. Tympanometry if diagnosis is uncertain. Council parents of newborns who fail NBHS of importance of f/u due to risk of SNHL. Should screen of OME in at-risk patients. **Watchful waiting recommended for** c**hild with OME w/o risk factors.** Don’t give steroids, antihistamines, or decongestants to childrens with OME. **OME >3months – get audiogram**. Re-eval patients with OME q3-6months until OME no longer present or hearing loss identified (yes, repeat hearing test q3-6months) or structural abnormalities/middle ear disease suspected. **Chronic OME + hearing loss or symptoms that are consistent w/ hearing loss** – book for tympanostomy tube placement.

## **SRBD/OSA**

* **Obtain PSG if:**

  
  1. obese >95%ile
  2. down syndrome
  3. craniofacial disorder
  4. neuromuscular disorder
  5. sickle cell or mucopolysaccaharidose patients
  6. when exam and history don’t match up
* **Tx:** T&A if tonsillar hypertrophy:

  
  1. Post-op admission in patients:
  2. <3yo
  3. with AHI >10 OR nadir <80%.
  4. PICU if severe enough


# Tonsillitis




1. **Paradise criteria**: tonsillectomy if:

   
   1. 7 infections/yr x 1 year,
   2. 5 infections/yr x 2 years
   3. 3 infections/yr x 3 years
2. Tonsillitis causing febrile convulsions, PTAx2, PFAPA (Periodic fever adenitis pharyngitis aphthous ulcers)


# Pediatric Vocal Fold Paralysis




1. Workup: **CXR** to r/o clavicular fx/TEF + **Echo** to r/o cardiac anoms + **Head U/S** to r/o hydro/chiari’s

   
   1. If neg: can consider MRI skull base to aortic arch (RLN protocol).
   2. If still negative, strongly consider bronch


## Pediatric Hearing Loss (failed newborn hearing screen)

Hearing screen should be done by 1 month old. If referred (failed), **ABR by 3 months old** and **early intervention by 6 months old**.


**Order:**

* **CMV** (PCR from urine saliva or IgM if <3weeks old) + **TORCH assay**
* **EKG** (r/o Jervell Lange Nielsen),
* **Ophtho consult** (see below)
* **Genetics testing**,
* **Thyroid U/S** (multinodular goiter = Pendred’s), Percholrate test (Pendred’s) isn’t used anymore,
* **BUN/Cr** to r/o Branchio-oto-renal or Alpert’s
* **Check:**
  * Eyes
    * Coloboma? Think CHARGE
    * Retinal detachment? Sticker’s
    * Hypopigmentation/heterochromia? Think Waardenberg
    * Retinitis Pigmentosa? Ushers
  * Genital abnormalities?
    * Think CHARGE
  * Extremities
    * Syndactyly + abnormal facies: think Apert, Cornelia de Lange
    * Absent radii: oromandibular limb dysgenesis
  * Ear abnormalities
    * Preauricular pits bilaterally? Get renal U/S to r/o Branchio-oto-renal
    * Aural atresia/microtia? Goldenhar/OAV/hemifacial macrosomia – look for vertebral abnormalities
  * Facial abnormalities
    * Craniosynotosis: Crouzon’s or Aperts
    * Broad based nose, Synophry (unibrow): think Waardenburg
  * Palate:
    * Sticker’s (retinal detachment, joint abnormalities
    * Treacher Collins (abnormal facies)
    * Oro-palato-digital syndrome (broad toes/fingers)
  * Facial nerve paralysis: Mobius syndrome (look for club foot, CNVI palsy), CHARGE, 22q11del, OAV
