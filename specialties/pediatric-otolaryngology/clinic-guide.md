New patient visit
format



\_\_\_\_\_ is a **-year-old patient born full term. No NICU admission, no
intubation, passed NBHS. No prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal problems.

#### 
F/U visit format



\_\_\_\_\_ is a **-year-old patient who is followed by this clinic for** .
He/She was last seen on ***, at that time*** was noted and the plan for

#### 
Pediatric ROS



**Ears: No** episodes of AOM. No otorrhea or otalgia. No
concerns for hearing loss. No difficulty with balance. No history of
speech delay.



**Nose**: Denies chronic nasal congestion or rhinorrhea.
No epistaxis. No history or symptoms of environmental allergies; no
formal allergy evaluation to date.



**Throat**: No snoring or mouth breathing at night. No
witnessed apneic pauses in breathing while sleeping. No nighttime
enuresis. No episodes of tonsillitis or frequent sore throats.



**Airway**: No dysphagia or odynophagia. Denies any
change in sound of voice or cry, no hoarseness. No gasping or choking
spells. No episodes of respiratory distress. (Stridor/how's the
patient's cry, choking w. food/hx of respiration PNA, weight loss/FTT,
blue spells)


### 
OME -
Clinical Practice Guidelines



**Recurrent AOM:** 3 discrete episodes of AOM in 6months
or 4 in past 12 months



**Chronic OME**: OME that persists for 3+ months



Always use pneumatic otoscopy. Tympanometry if diagnosis is
uncertain. Council parents of newborns who fail NBHS of importance of
f/u due to risk of SNHL. Should screen of OME in at-risk patients.
**Watchful waiting recommended for** c**hild with OME
w/o risk factors.** Don't give steroids, antihistamines, or
decongestants to childrens with OME. **OME \>3months -- get
audiogram**. Re-eval patients with OME q3-6months until OME no
longer present or hearing loss identified (yes, repeat hearing test
q3-6months) or structural abnormalities/middle ear disease suspected.
**Chronic OME + hearing loss or symptoms that are consistent w/
hearing loss** -- book for tympanostomy tube placement.
**Recurrent AOM**: book for tympanostomy tube placement if
OME seen on day of visit. **Patients \>4yo should get an
adenoidectomy with ear tubes.**



**SRBD/OSA**



- 

Obtain PSG if: (1) obese \>95^th^ %ile (2) down
syndrome (3) craniofacial disorder (4) neuromuscular disorder (5) sickle
cell or mucopolysaccaharidose patients (6) when exam and history don't
match up



- 

Tx: T&A if tonsillar hypertrophy: Post-op admission in
patients (1) \10 or nadir \ DiGeorge)


id="timeline-for-cleft-lippalate-patients"\>Timeline for Cleft Lip/Palate
patients

- 

Birth: taping, lip adhesion, NAM (nasoalveolar molding),



- 

10 weeks: Cleft lip repair. Ear tubes (rule of 10s: 10 HgB, 10
weeks, 10 lbs) +/- primary rhinoplasty



- 

10 months: Cleft palate repair:



- 

6-12 years: consider revision rhino



- 

3-5 years: speech surgery



- 

14-18 years: definitive orthognathic and rhinoplasty
procedures

Pierre Robin
Sequence



- 

Work Up



- 

Birth history:



- 

gestation age, weight, complications of pregnancy: did mum
smoking, use opioids,



- 

delivery, complications,



- 

Current status and work-up:



- 

Stable/unstable?



- 

Respiratory status: intubated, desats, PCO2, blue spells



- 

Cardiac: Tetrology of Fallot (VSD, Aortic valve over ventricular
septum, RV outflow obstruction, RV hypertrophy) Truncus arteriosus) -
Think VCFS/DiGeorge



- 

Neuro: reflexes? Tone? Important to determine Trach vs
MDO



- 

GI: weight gain? Ability to tolerate PO? Determines in MDO is
needed, how severe symptoms are



- 

Eyes: Lower lid coloboma? Treacher Collins; Large eyes, myopia,
Retinal detachment Sticklers



- 

Hearing: Treacher Collins, Sticklers



- 

Hypocalcemia: VCFS



- 

Extremities: absent radii? Nager



- 

Family History



- 

One of the parents has it? Treacher Collins, Sticklers are
autosomal dominant



- 

Exam



- 

Vitals including the trend of weight, PO intake (in % of overall
feeds)



- 

Head & Neck Exam: looking for ocular abnormalities, auricular
abnormalities, symmetry of facial features, size/shape of jaw, cleft
palate,



- 

Other: Neuro exam: reflexes and tone. Extremities, respiratory
status (accessory muscle use)



- 

Perform fiberoptic exam: assess base of tongue obstruction and
for other airway lesions (phrayngeal narrowing, anterior glottic
web)



- 

Lab Work



- 

pCO2 - check if intervention is needed



- 

Ca2+: hypocalcemia? Think VCFS



- 

Microarray?



- 

Radiology



- 

CT facial bone if planning internal distraction.



- 

Associated syndromes



- 

MC: Sticklers -\> DiGeorge -\> Treacher Collins -\>
Goldenhar -\> Nager Syndrome




### 
Microtia/Aural
Atresia



Workup: If newborn hearing screen on contralateral ear is ok, can
delay formal audiogram until 6-7 months of age (ABR if fails on
#### 
Microtia



**Grade I**: cup or lop ear. **Grade II**:
rudimentary subunits **Grade III**: peanut ear
**Grade IV**: anotia



Most commonly right side, seen in men.



Ask: about teratogens (isotretinoin, thalidomide, vascular insults
during pregnancy)



Look for associated conditions: **Goldenhar**
(mandibular hypoplasia/hemifacial microsomia â†’ OAV if spine defects
noted) **CHARGE** (coloboma, heart defects, choanal
atresia, retardation, genital hypoplasia, ear abnormalities)



For crypotia, stahl ear or other partial deformations, noted at
birth, wait 1 week to see if ear self corrects (1/3 of cases) then can
weeks). After 6 weeks, cannot mold


#### 
Aural Atresia



Associated w/ microtia in 55-90%.



**Jahrsdoerfer** (10 total points, \>7 = candidate for
repair) **SOME FIRMM**:



**S**tapes present (2 points), **O**val
window, **M**iddle ear space, **E**xternal ear
appearance



**F**acial nerve, **I**ncus-stapes
connection, **R**ound window,
**M**alleus-Incus complex **M**astoid
pneumatization



No need to get CT before 4 years of age. CT to evaluate for
**cholesteatoma** + to assess if candidate for aural
atresia repair. Aural atresia repaired AFTER microtia (because you want
skin w/ excellent blood supply for microtia)
