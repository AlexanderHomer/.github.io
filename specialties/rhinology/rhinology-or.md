## Surgical Planning: The CT Sinus Scan

### Maxillary Antrostomy

* Look at coronal & axial
* Identify uncinate process and its relation to medial orbital wall. **Check that it is not lateralized as a lateralized uncinate = easy orbital entry**
* Look for **Haller cells** (infraorbital cells) as these crowd middle meatus and can be hard to reach
* Look on floor of maxillary sinus for **retention cyst/polyp** (if present, may need angled instruments)

### Ethmoidectomy/Sphenoidectomy (Figure 8)

* Sagittal Look at **slope of skull base** the more it slopes, the lower your entry through the basal lamella should be **(image 1 below)**
* The height of the skull base doesn't matter as much as the difference between the height of the **roof of maxillary to height of skull base** matters. Maxillary sinus roof is ur landmark, if the maxillary sinus roof is high, and skull base is low, u may enter basal lamella too high **(image 2)**
* **Keros classification:** Distance between fovea ethmoidalis & cribriform plate. 
  * Type I: 1-3mm; 
  * Type 2: 3-7mm; 
  * Type 3 (most dangerous) 7-16mm **(Image 2)**
* Identify **onodi cells** (check coronals) - this is a posterior ethmoid cell superior or lateral to sphenoid. Important because the sphenoid isn't posterior to it but the optic nerve/apex is! **(Image 3)**
* Check i**ntrasinus septum of sphenoid** (check axials) to make sure its doesn't lead to carotid **(Image 4)**

### Frontal Sinusotomy

* Check sagittal. Determine **anterior-posterior dimension of frontal recess**. 
  * If small, stripping the mucosa in the recess = high likelihood of restenosis
* Check for extra cells

  
  1. **Around bullae:** retrobullar, suprabullar, frontal bullar,
  2. **Around orbit:** supraorbital ethmoid cell
  3. Around frontal recess

     
     1. **Agger nasi**
     2. Type 1 (the 1st cell above agger nasi)
     3. Type 2 any cells that are above Type 1 but don't go into frontal sinus
     4. Type 3, any cell that extends into frontal sinus
     5. Type 4 within frontal sinus

## SONERU FESS SET UP / PROCEDURE

* Soneru typically sends **pre-operative antibiotics, steroids, and nasal saline rinses** (NeilMed Sinus Rinse)
* Once in the OR, intubate patient and **tape the tube to the left lower lip.**
* Turn **90 Degrees counter-clockwise**. **Video tower should be at the left** side of the patient’s head across from where you will stand. Medtronic **Stealth Navigation tower will be placed to the right of the video tower.**
* Place **Afrin soaked pledgets** in bilateral nasal cavities.
* **Microdebrider**, **Medtronic navigation instruments**, and **FESS trays** are needed for standard FESS
* **Have suction electrocautery** and **nasopores** for hemostasis


### REBEIZ FESS SET UP / PROCEDURE

* TELL ANESTHESIA: Ancef or clinda, NOT before cultures are taken. ETT to the left (no oral rae) no eye protection.
* PATIENT SET-UP: Gel donut head rest. No turning, bring bed south a bit away from anesthesia, mild reverse tberg. Nothing on the eye (no ointment, no tegaderm). Make sure headpiece screws are tightened. Tuck arms. Throat pack (vag pack). Pack nasal cavity with afrin. Prep with 5% betadine just on nose. Drape with blue towels: 1 over lip and 1 above fusion forehead, no towel clamps, split sheet.
* EQUIPMENT/FUSION SET-UP: Tower on opposite side, slave tower on surgeon side. Fusion monitor under surgeon monitor. Set up fusion: attach forehead sticker and adjust the sticker on fusion screen to match. Fusion sensing probe 1 fist away from face. Drape fusion with lahey bag. Register fusion first before anything! After registered and confirmed, remove probe and register two fusion suctions (curved and straight). Suction should be connected with silastic tubing. Do not open microdebrider unless rebeiz wants it. If microdebrider is used, ask scrub to set it up first (takes time to calibrate) 0 degree 4mm rigid hopkins rod, white balance and focus. Fred on patient's right cheek. Wet sponge too.

**SURGERY:**

 ![Surgery](../../media/image27.png)

* **Inject** 1% lido + epi : root of middle turb and lateral nasal wall. Inject with patties in place in middle meatus
* Remove packs, use upbiting forceps to medialize middle turb.
* **Turbinoplasty** with up biting tru-cut along inferomedial, inferior, inferolateral surface of middle turb and hold medially for 30 secs
* **Uncinectomy**: Use **ostium seeker** to probe max ostium. With **cottle**, perform uncinectomy, then remove inferior portion with a small **backbiter**. Use **ostium seeker** to pull the superior uncinate and remove with a **upbiting tru-bite**. Used **curved navigation suction** to confirm you’ve opened it up.
* **Widen maxillary antrostomy:** by excising the posterior fontanelle posterior to the maxillary os with a **straight tru-bite**
* **Anterior ethmoidectomy:** enter ethmoid bullae with suction, remove pieces with **blakesley forcep**
* **Posterior ethmoidectomy**: identify basal lamella (horizontal/vertical portion). Enter basal lamella with a **j curette** on inferior/medial aspect below level of the roof of the maxillary sinus

 ![Figure 10: Palmer and Chiu, Atlas of Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery.](../../image28.png)

* **Sphenoidotomy**: anterior face of sphenoid = 7cm from nasal sill. Find it medial to superior turbinate or the bolger’s box method (the box is superior turbinate \[medial\], lamina papyracea \[laterally\], skull base, basal lamella: locate it inferior/medially). Use a straight tru-bite to transect lower 1/3 of superior turbinate to better visualize sphenoid os, then use j curette to enlarge os **laterally**
* Come back along skull base using **J curette**
* **Frontal sinusotomy:** Enter frontal sinus with **ostium seeker** then curved suction. Take down the superior part of the uncinate if that hasn’t already been done. If there is an agger nasi cell, get a **45 or 70 degree scope** and take down <u>inferior</u> part of agger nasi. <u>Do not strip mucosa</u>. A lot of people just do balloon dilation for frontal sinus
* Pack and repeat on other side.

**Closing:**

* Surgiflo in middle meatus. Suction surgiflo, place kennedy pack in middle meatus. Irrigate nasal cavity to inflate pack then place bactroban around pack in middle meatus. Suction floor of nose to nasopharynx.
* Benzoine along nasal tip. Tie kennedy packs and secure to dorsum with steristrips. Remove throat pack.

**Post-op:**

* Keflex or clinda (if permanent packing in place)
* f/u a week (Tuesday or Thursday)
