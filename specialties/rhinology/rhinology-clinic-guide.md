## Allergy

### Allergic Rhinitis – Clinical Practice Guideline






1. **Dx:** nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose or sneezing with an allergic etiology
2. **Workup:** can treat empirically but if no response or if you want to target therapy get allergy testing (aka: pretty much always get allergy testing)

   
   1. Ask about allergies to pollen, animals, insects, molds.
3. **Medical treatment:**

   
   1. Nasal steroids (Flonase/Nasacort/Nasonex/Rhinocort)
   2. Can give oral 2nd gen antihistamines if sneezing, itching
   3. Can give intranasal antihistamines for seasonal or episodic AR (Olopatadine/Azelastine/Dymista) 1-2 sprays 1-2x/day
   4. **Don’t give Montelukast**
4. **Avoidance:**

   
   1. **Dust:** dust resistant mattress covers, hard floors, plastic pillow cases, acaricides (chemicals that kill dust mites)
   2. **Mold:** dehumidify basements, clean fridge, throw away old blankets etc
   3. **Pollen:** air filters, keep windows closed
   4. **Animals:** shoot the animals (jokes) but can recommend washing animals more frequently (not great evidence)
5. **Inferior turbinate reduction:** can be offered if allergic rhinitis + nasal obstruction + enlarged inferior turbinates + failed medical management.

   
   1. Dr. Rebeiz likes to offer one side at a time to see if patients get a response before he does the other side.
6. **Can offer immunotherapy for refractory cases:**

   
   1. Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT)

      
      1. Higher risk of anaphylaxis
      2. Give 5-20ug of allergan. Given in physician’s office
      3. More likely to be covered by insurance
      4. More likely to cause SOB, wheezing
   2. Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT)

      
      1. Probably safer and more effective
      2. 1st dose in office. After that, administered at home
      3. More likely to cause GI upset

### **Allergy testing**:






1. **Skin testing:** contraindicated in eczema, uncontrolled asthma, cardiovascular disease or on beta-blockers (Can do blood tests on these patients instead).

   
   1. **Patients should stop antihistamines 48-72hrs prior**
2. **Intradermal Skin Allergies Testing:** Inject 0.01-0.02mL of antigen into dermis with 27G needle to make a 2-3mm wheal. Dilute the extract 100-1000 times less than the concentration for skin extract.

   
   1. Wheal and flare is read in 15-20 minutes.
   2. Increase concentration 1:5 until wheal enlarges (use 1ml of previous strength + 4ml of dilute)

 ![Allergens (will associated oral allergy triggers)](../../media/image23.png)

* **Spring** — trees (birch) → Apples, Peaches, Carrots, Peanuts
* **Summer** — grass → dates, orange, tomato, watermelon
* **Summer/Fall** — Mugwort → celery, carrots
* **Fall** — Ragweed → bananas, melon
* **Nighttime** — dust mites
* **Cross-reactive oral allergens**:
* Peach → 55% of apple, plum, pear
* Cantaloupe → 92% avocado, banana, kiwi
* Latex → 30-50% avocado, banana, kiwi
* Pediatric Allergens
* Most likely to resolve - Cow's Milk & Eggs
* Least likely to resolve with age - Tree nuts, then peanuts)

### Other causes of Rhinitis

**Acid reflux**. MCC of rhinitis. Especially at night.

**Rhinoscleroma:** nasal deformity 2/2 klebsiella

**Rhinosporidososis**: strawberry friable nasal mass 2/2 rhinosporidium seebri

**Nonallergic rhinitis w/ eosinophilia Syndrome (NARES):** associated w/ aspirin allergies.

**Rhinitis of pregnancy**: avoid afrin. Consider turbinate reduction

**Atrophic Rhinitis**: Includes empty nose syndrome.

**Rhinitis Medicamentosa**: due to overuse of afrin

**Vasomotor Rhinitis**: diagnosis of exclusion.

## Sinusitis – Clinical Practice Guideline (*Italicized* = not part of guidelines)

**ARS**: purulent nasal **drainage** accompanied by nasal **obstruction**, facial **pain**-pressure fullness,

or both.

* **Suspect Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) if symptoms >10days or get better then worse.**
  * If you see patients w/ symptoms <10days, this is likely viral: give Flonase, nasal saline, Tylenol/ibuprofen.
* **ABRS:**
  * amox or augmentin x5-10days (doxycycline or levoquin or moxifloxacin for PCN allergic patients).
  * Can do watchful waiting for 7 days in reliable patients.
    * If no improvement after 7 days: give antibiotics (if watchful waiting) or change antibiotics (if patient given amox/augmentin, do doxycycline, Levaquin, or combo clindamycin + 3rd gen cephalosporin)
* ***Frontal sinusitis:*** *treat more aggressively*
* **Recurrent ABRS**: 4+ episodes a year with periods where symptoms are gone
* **Chronic Rhinosinusitis**: >12 weeks of symptoms.
  * Confirm diagnosis with clinical exam (anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy) or CT sinus.
  * Patients should be evaluated for asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia +/- allergy and immunology testing.
  * Patients should be evaluated for polyps.
* **Tx:** Flonase and/or saline.
  * Some evidence that macrolides or budesonide rinses maybe useful for CRS w/ polyps but not officially recommended.
  * Don’t give antifungals.
* ***If no response to Flonase***\*, can give course of oral steroids (2-4 week) + antibiotics (macrolides especially – for 3-6 weeks) at same time (especially for CRSw/ polyps)\*

## Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis






1. **Major Criteria (Bent & Kuhn)**

   
   1. Type 1 hypersensitivity (skin or serology testing)
   2. Nasal poylps
   3. Double density sign on CT sinus
   4. Eosinophilic mucus w/o fungal invasion
   5. Positive fungal stain of sinus content
2.  ![Mycetoma (Fungal Ball): typically aspergillus (Y-shaped 45 degree septated hyphae) in one sinus treated with surgery](../../media/image24.png)
3. **Tx:** oral/nasal steroids. Surgical debridement

## Invasive Fungal Sinusitis





1. Seen in immunocompromised (diabetics, transplant pts, HIV+)
2. Typically Mucor (nonseptate 90degree broad based)
3. **Dx:** MRI shows T1 w/ gad: absent mucosal enhancement (2/2 necrosis) – invasion outside sinus is enhanced.

## Nasal Polyps

* **Causes:** CRS, Cystic Fibrosis, Trauma, Churg-Strauss
* **Ask:** Asthma? ASA sensitivity? (Samter’s Triad = severe, recurring, recalcitrant form of disease)
* **R/O:** encephalocele, inverted papilloma, glioma, antrochoanal polyp (retention cyst of max sinus that protrudes through antrum).
  * **Get CT scan, allergy test**
* **Surgical Tx:** Do FESS – polypectomy, sphenoidethmoidectomy, max antrostomy. Send specimen to r/o inverted papilloma
* **Medical Tx:** **aggressive allergy mgmt, flonase**
  * +/- rhinocort aqua (Budesonide) or Azelastine HCl 137mcg/spray (H1 blocker) \[2 sprays BID\],
  * avoid ASA
* ***Severe disease*:** consider low-dose steroids, budesonide rinses, corticosteroid eluding stents (propel)

## Inverted Papilloma




1. Caused by HPV 6/11.
2. Have **Schneiderian mucosa** on path report
3. Tend to be unilateral + vascular. Occur on lateral nasal wall. Require Medial Maxillectomy. Freq involve middle turbinate
4. 10% risk of becoming **SCCA**

## Other Nasal Mass Vignettes




1. Bluish mass behind middle turbinate in adolescent male w/ hx of epistaxis→ **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma**
2. Friable mass on septum in pregnant women → **pyogenic granuloma** (Lobular capillary hemangioma)
3. Unilateral OME in elderly Chinese male → **Nasopharyngeal CA**
4. Nasal mass in wood and leather workers → **adenocarcinoma**
5. Brown friable mass that has bimodal distribution (teens and elderly) → **esthesioneuroblastoma**
6. Male with a few years of clear rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction develops septal perforation, rapidly progressive ulceration around nasal cavity → **Lethal Midline Granuloma**

## Epistaxis

### **Anatomy**



1. **Anterior bleeds:** 1) int carotid -> ophthalmic -> ant. ethmoid 2) ext carotid -> facial -> superior labial 3) ext carotid -> int max -> greater palatine 4) ext carotid -> int max -> sphenopalatine
2. **Posterior bleeds:** 1) ext carotid -> int max -> sphenopalatine 2) ext carotid -> ascending pharyngeal

### Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia

* Autosomal dominant.
* **Tx:** NdYAG laser.
* **For acute bleeds in the ED:** surgiflo works well.
* **Saunder’s dermoplasty**: removal telangiectic mucosa and replaced with STSG
* **Young’s procedure**: close nasal cavity.

## Adult Obstructive Sleep Apnea

* *See Dr. Wein’s Head & Neck clinic section for Inspire patients*
* **Apnea** = cessation of nasal air pressure \[defined as 90% of baseline\] (for >10secs)
* **Hypopnea**:
  * 30+4 criteria: drop in 30% of baseline nasal air pressure + 4% O2 desat (for >10 secs)
  * 30+3/arousal criteria: drop in 30% of baseline + 3% O2 desat **or** an arousal (>10secs)
* **AHI**: Apnea+hypopnea per hour.
  * AHI > 5 = OSA. 
  * >15 = moderate. 
  * >30 = severe
* **RERA**: Arousal preceded by inc. respiratory effort (for >10sec)
* **RDI**: Apnea+hypopnea+RERA/hour
* **Central Apnea:** cessation of respiratory effort during apnea. 
  * >5 central apneas/hour = primary central sleep apnea.

### Evaluation

* Perform fiberoptic scope w/ exam to determine site of collapse:
  * **Nose:** septum, turbinates, nasal valve → improves CPAP compliance, doesn’t affect AHI
  * **Nasopharynx:** Adenoids?
  * **Velopharynx:** do **Mullers maneuver**: attempt to breathing in with mouth/nose closed. 
    * **If >50% collapse**→ retropalatal/retrolingual collapse (velopharynx)
    * Can address with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) or lateral pharyngoplasty (but this can make air leak w/ CPAP worse). Midface/Mandibular advancement for severe cases
  * **Oral Cavity:** tonsillar hypertrophy
  * **OP/Hypopharyngeal:** lingual tonsillectomy, genioglossal advancement, hyoid suspension, INSPIRE placement

### Zenkers Diverticulum

* Presents w/ dysphagia and regurgitation of indigested food


* **Pulsion** diverticulum at Killians Triangle (between cricopharyngeus and inferior constrictor). 
* Occurs on left side 90% of time

### Nasal Cavity/Sinus Cancer

* **Ask:** about exposure to heavy metals and job (woodworkers inc. rate of SCCA (if soft wood work) and Adenocarcinoma (if hard wood))
* **Types**:
  * SCCA
  * Adenocarcinoma (in wood/leather workers)
  * Adenoid Cystic (slow groeth)
  * Melanoma (bad)
  * Esthesioneuroblastoma (teens and elderly) 
  * Rhabdomyosarcoma (pleomorphic MC in adults). 
  * Chordoma (from clivus/skull base) or chondro/osteosarcomas: bad. 
  * Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (bluish mass at post. aspect of middle turbinate. Consider preop embolization, hormonal therapy)

### Otolaryngologic Manifestations of Autoimmune Diseases

* **W.A.S.: Autoimmune** laryngeal manifestations → 
  * Wegener’s=supraglottic. 
  * Amyloid = Glottic. 
  * Sarcoidosis= Subglottic
* **Wegener’s (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis GPA):** 
  * MC H&N symptom recurrent sinusitis. 
  * Also associated w/ septal perforation, chronic otitis, subglottic stenosis. 
  * **Order c-ANCA**
* **Amyloidosis**: 
  * causes macroglossia, deposits on TVF. 
  * **Requires biopsy for diagnosis**
* **Sarcoidosis**: 
  * can cause **supraglottic mass** (epiglottis) w/ TVF immobility. 
  * Also risk of FN palsy (w/ uveitis and parotitis = Heerfordt’s disease) 
  * **Order ACE levels**
