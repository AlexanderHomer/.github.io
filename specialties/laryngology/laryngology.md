Structure of Clinic Note
(Hron)



Gen- NAD. Voice frequent pitch fluctuations. no rhythmic tremor with
sustained "a". Voice strained without pitch fluctuations during
stroboscopy



Head - No facial swelling/edema.



Eyes - conjunctiva clear



Ears - EACs clear. TMs intact. MEs aerated



Nose - no purulence or masses



OC/OP - no oc/op masses.



Neck - no lad/masses



Resp - no wob/stridor



Neuro - Face symm. Symm tongue protusion. Symm palate elev.



TRANSNASAL DISTAL CHIP STROBOSCOPY - s/p lidocaine and phenylephrine
applied topically to the nares. Distal chip endoscope introduced
transnasally. BOT without masses. Piriforms without pooling of
secretions or masses. Arytenoids fully mobile. Mild to moderate
interarytenoid edema. Vocal folds without masses or mucosal
abnormalities. Mucosal wave intact and symmetric. Moderate false vocal
fold compression during phonation. Complete glottic closure. No tremor
or voice changes during phonation

How to perform stroboscopy



- 

Sniff and ee



- 

Sniff x3 quickly



- 

Glide low to high eee (see if they have symmetric
stretch).



- 

Start high and go low



- 

Eehe eehe eehe eehe as fast as they can-- some people have subtle
weaknesses that show up when you do that. Clues you into which side the
paresis is on. Like rapid alternating movements for the larynx.



- 

We were away a year ago.



- 

Most comfortable pitch and loudness.




### 
Stroboscopy findings



- 

"SAPMuC"



- 

Symmetry (i.e. position, shape, mass, tension)



- 

If immobile, note position: paramedian, median, intermediate or
lateral



- 

RLN paralysis: in paramedian position. Adduction
preserved



- 

SLN Paralysis: lowers voice pitch, bowing deformity, decreased
sensation



- 

RLN+SLN: cadaveric position





- 

Arytenoids: posterior commissure points to paralyzed side in SLN
paralysis





- 

Amplitude (medial to lateral excursion from the midline during
vibration)



- 

Periodicity (most important)- if strobe doesn't pic up vibration,
it's aperiodic.



- 

Mucosal wave- is there a wave traveling over the vocal fold and
laterally



- 

Glottic Closure - how we describe the pattern of VFs touching



- 

Complete (long vs short) closure--Frame by frame analysis should
be 1:1 open to closed.



- 

Posterior gap (can be normal in Females)



- 

Hour glass (bumps)



- 

Anterior gap



- 

Elliptical -- atrophy



- 

Irregular (post radiation/cancer/scar)



- 

Transglottic- air escape





- 

Supraglottic Activity- Muscle tension dysphonia → send to
SLP



- 

Tests for Spasmodic Dysphonia



- 

ADDuctor SD (more common): Ask them to count from 80→90 or say
"we eat eggs everyday". Inject TA/LCA.



- 

Abductor SD: Count from 60→70 "the puppy bit the tape". Inject
PCA muscle






### 
Laryngopharyngeal
Reflux Treatment Algorithm



- 

Gives patient a choice of empiric qd/qhs PPI/ranitidine
vs. up-front testing pH-impedance



- 

If pH testing shows acid events--\>PPI



- 

If pH testing shows non-acid events --\> alginates
vs. Nissen



- 

For any long-standing reflux events have to send to GI for EGD
for Barretts esophagus testing.



- 

Alginates eg: Gaviscon advance liquid from UK (order on amazon) ---
1 teaspoons after meals and qhs (It's the only non-surgical barrier to
reflux that exists)



- 

If completely negative (no reflux events, no acid)--\> get
allergy testing (for itchy nose, watery eyes, cat allergy). Then start
amitriptyline for chronic throat clearing




### 
Hoarseness -- Clinical
Practice Guideline



Don't prescribe reflux for symptoms alone, must have FOE showing
reflux related changes. Don't give Rx for steroids, Abx either. Should
do FOE prior to given Rx for voice therapy. Botox for spasmodic
dysphonia.
