title: Radiology - Levels of the Neck
---
Radiologic reports use the same neck level system to localize lymph nodes on CT or MRI.



- 
Use the carotid artery, hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage as landmarks to distinguish levels II through IV.

- 
Nodes posterior to the sternocleidomastoid correspond to level V.

- 
The central compartment around the larynx and trachea is level VI.
