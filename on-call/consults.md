Think posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there
is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior
aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the
maxillary sinus) For posterior bleeds, can use:

Rule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires

It's never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both
sides, take at least one of them out.

ED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see
an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is
coming from and why it is happening. `<strong>`{=html}Find the bleeding

Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet
forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should
get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and
not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold
pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and
numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a
Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties
back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you
visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming
from.

`<strong>`{=html}If its anterior`</strong>`{=html} and a vessel can be seen, use a
silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before
and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop
down onto patients' lips and discolor their skin.

`<strong>`{=html}If it's posterior: use a posterior pack`</strong>`{=html}. Pumping
vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing
the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior

`<strong>`{=html}Operative Steps:`</strong>`{=html} Place shoulder roll. mark out
midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm
incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep
& drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop
skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision
and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets
midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don't open to
wide (you'll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always
look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see
straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes
under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army
navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can
also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming
up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia
off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3`<sup>`{=html}rd`</sup>`{=html} tracheal
rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff,
put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask
anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by
making two horizontal incisions over 2`<sup>`{=html}nd`</sup>`{=html} and 3`<sup>`{=html}rd`</sup>`{=html}
tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of
trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the
incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to
withdraw circuit until it's just above window then, if you have time,
place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner
cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return,
secure trach w/ 4-point sutures & Velcro trach tie.
