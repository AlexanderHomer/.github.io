# Consults

## Epistaxis

* Most bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.
* Check for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry environment, cocaine use. Check the BP, coags, platelets. Find out which side the bleed started
* Bring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope, phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel, Surgifoam, Bactroban, ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 & #9 Frazier tip suction, silver nitrate cautery.
* Can bring thrombigel or ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you want to get fancy
* Think posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the maxillary sinus)
* For posterior bleeds, can use:
  * 10F Foley – Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/ 10cc, pull until balloon wedges against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal alar. Monitor for palate necrosis
  * Epistat – put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with 7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw until balloon wedges against posterior nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.
  * Ant/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) – works well. Inflate until the patient can’t tolerate it anymore
  * Rule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires hospital admission and pulse ox monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia you are monitoring for)
* It’s never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both sides, take at least one of them out.
* ED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is coming from and why it is happening. Find the bleeding source


•	Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming from.

* If its anterior and a vessel can be seen, use a silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop down onto patients’ lips and discolor their skin.
* If its further back (mid septum), wrap surgicel around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and press it against the area that’s bleeding.
* If it’s posterior: use a posterior pack. Pumping vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.
* If it’s an HHT patient. Surgiflo seems to work best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with it.


## PTAs

* CBC w/ Diff; Rapid Strep; Monospot
* Decadron 10 mg IV x 1 (only if drained or neg needle aspiration + neg CT for abscess;
* Unasyn IV or Clindamycin (PCN allergic) x1 only if CBC shows no atypical lymphocytes & monospot is negative; then continue PO x 7-14 days
* To Drain: yankeur suction at bedside, 18-gauge needle, >27-gauge needle, 10 mL syringe, 5 mL syringe, lidocaine with epi, tongue depressor, 15 blade, Kelly clamp, hurricane spray
* Hurricane spray -> lido w/ epi -> You can needle aspirate to localize the region. March down the side of the peritonsillar space, it can be lower than you think. When you strike gold, send it for culture, then do an I&D w/ a #15 blade and spread with clamp.
* Low threshold to scope (unless you have a CT) to clear the airway as edema can track down



## Tracheostomy

* Family discussion completed by primary team (you aren’t responsible for that talk)


* Coagulation
  * Platelet, H/H, INR/PTT
  * Anticoagulation (why? Can it be shut off) – lovenox stop 24hrs before, heparin gtt 4-5 hours before - see anticoagulation guide
* Intubation hx (PEEP (PEEP >8 makes trachs much more difficult – pts quickly desat, trach has higher risk of dislodging) duration, traumatic? Tube size? Extubation attempts, exposure)
* **Operative Steps:** Place shoulder roll. mark out midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep & drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don’t open to wide (you’ll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3rd tracheal rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff, put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by making two horizontal incisions over 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to withdraw circuit until it’s just above window then, if you have time, place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return, secure trach w/ 4-point sutures & Velcro trach tie.


## Angioedema

* Look for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema.
* Always scope to r/o airway edema.
* Labs: get complement protein, C4 levels, and C1-INH (low levels -> suspect C1 esterase deficiency).
  * Also get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP, ESR
* Causes: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs
* Time frame: Histamine related - comes & goes within 12 hours
  * Lisinopril related – can take 2 days for swelling to decrease
  * Hereditary angioedema – can take DAYS
* Rec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.
  * If hereditary angioedema, can consider:

    
    1. Purified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest).
    2. Ecallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)
    3. Icatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist
  * If significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise admit to MICU overnight for airway monitoring and rescope in morning
* Have a game plan for intubation – speak to Anesthesia to notify that patient is being admitted, provide plan for intubation, nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.


## Parotitis/Sialadenitis

* MASH: Massage, antibiotics, sialagogues (lemon drops, orange wedges), hydration/heat.


## Ear Foreign Body

* Always ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with tuning fork exam
* Ask the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan) is rarely enough
* Get a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it behind the foreign body and pop it out
* If the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid putting in drops as this could cause the foreign body to swell


## Fish Bone

* Do a fiberoptic exam. If you can’t see it, offer a thin-cut CT w/o contrast through the larynx
* If fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4% lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb the posterior oropharynx
* Use the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill forceps
* Have a nurse wrap patient’s tongue with gauze and pull it out to improve access.
* For children, it’s often easier to go to the OR.


## Orbital Cellulitis


1. **Preseptal vs Orbital Cellulitis:**

   
   1. Orbital cellulitis is likely to have chemosis, pain with EOMI, restricted eye movement
2. **When to drain a subperiosteal abscess?** 

   
   1. If the abscess volume is <1250mm3 can avoid OR (measure abscess in 3 dimensions WxDxL in mm)
3. **How to tell if there is a cavernous sinus thrombosis:** get a MRI with contrast.

   
   1. Look at DTI/DWI (isoDTI) - if the Cavernous sinus lights up, strong indication for Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Look for edema. If in the vessels, think of thrombophlebitis.
      * Rule out shine through.  ADC map (dDTI) should be the opposite of the DWI (isoDTI) if it’s true. If they are the same, this is shine through effect.
   2. On T1 post contrast - look for filling defect. Then confirm on DWI.
      * 1-2mm should be size of superior ophthalmic vein. Expect it to be dilated on both sides


## Airway patients with stridor

* Ask: onset of stridor + speed of progression. Eval for infectious vs inflammatory vs foreign body vs neoplastic
* Evaluate: O2 sat, respiratory rate, retractions, ability to lay supine. Stridor: insp: supraglottic/glottic. Biphasic: glottic/subglottic. Expiratory: trachea/bronchi. Perform fiberoptic exam and check airway
* Management:

  
  1. **Airway widely patent and mild edema, slow progression of symptoms** → observation on floor w/ O2 monitoring
  2. **Airway patent but moderate edema (e.g. angioedema patients)** → observation in ICU
  3. **Unable to entire airway** → OR for awake fiberoptic intubation w/ possible awake trach
  4. **Unable to see any airway** → OR for awake trach
* **==Surgical Airway Patients==**

  
  1. Alert an attending
  2. Nasal trumpet, Heliox if increased WOB
  3. Bag Mask (may not be the best) or LMA
  4. If stable, perform fiberoptic exam. If intubation needed, try and do in OR


## Pediatric Stridor

* Scope with nursing and bag mask equipment available. Always ask the NICU RN before you even touch a kid in the NICU
*  When you scope, scope around the nasal cannula, don’t remove it
* No reflux medications in NICU babies unless the attending clears it (causes NEC)
* DDX:

  
  1. Laryngomalacia
  2. VF immobility: see VF immobility workup in Pedi ENT section
  3. Complete tracheal rings
     * Get echo, head u/s +/- MRI
     * MBS if VF immobility
     * Low threshold for DLB


## Transfers

* Never accept an unstable transfer.
* No direct admits unless one of our attendings has accepted it. In general, transfers go through the ED


## Admissions from ED


In general, we have adopted the same model as Orthopedics.

* **Admit to Medicine with ENT consult:** Adults with non-surgical issue (peritonsillar phlegmon, angioedema) or surgical issue + multiple co-morbidities (taking medications for T2DM and HTN) or is high risk (history of MI)
* **Admit to ENT:** Adults with non-complicated surgical patients (e.g.: retropharyngeal abscess) and those with post-op complications (unless it is purely medical e.g. poor PO intake, pain control etc.).
* **Admit to Pediatrics:** Typically, all pediatric patients except those with post-surgical complications go to Pediatrics


**General rule:** Be reasonable. Medicine are reasonable…which means they tend to get dumped on a lot. We should take the simple patients onto our service. At the same time, recognize that we are in the ORs during the day and are home-call at night so don’t have the manpower to manage difficult patients.
Inpatient or bedded outpatient patients who had surgery: they come to our service.
