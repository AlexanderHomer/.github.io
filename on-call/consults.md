Epistaxis
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Most bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry
environment, cocaine use. Check the BP, coags, platelets. Find out which
side the bleed started
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope,
phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel, Surgifoam, Bactroban,
ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 &
#9 Frazier tip suction, silver nitrate cautery. Can bring thrombigel or
ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you want to get fancy
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Think posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there
is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior
aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the
maxillary sinus) For posterior bleeds, can use:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>
10F Foley -- Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/
10cc, pull until balloon wedges against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal
alar. Monitor for palate necrosis
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Epistat -- put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with
7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw until balloon wedges against posterior
nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ant/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) -- works well. Inflate until the
patient can't tolerate it anymore
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires
hospital admission and pulse ox monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia
you are monitoring for)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It's never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both
sides, take at least one of them out.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>
ED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see
an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is
coming from and why it is happening. `<strong>Find the bleeding
source`</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet
forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should
get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and
not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold
pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and
numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a
Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties
back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you
visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming
from.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
`<strong>If its anterior`</strong> and a vessel can be seen, use a
silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before
and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop
down onto patients' lips and discolor their skin.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
`<strong>If its further back (mid septum)`</strong>, wrap surgicel
around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and press it against the area
that's bleeding.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
`<strong>If it's posterior: use a posterior pack`</strong>. Pumping
vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing
the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior
aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
`<strong>If it's an HHT patient`</strong>. Surgiflo seems to work
best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with it.

`<strong>Operative Steps:`</strong> Place shoulder roll. mark out
midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm
incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep
& drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop
skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision
and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets
midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don't open to
wide (you'll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always
look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see
straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes
under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army
navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can
also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming
up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia
off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3`<sup>rd`</sup> tracheal
rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff,
put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask
anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by
making two horizontal incisions over 2`<sup>nd`</sup> and 3`<sup>rd`</sup>
tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of
trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the
incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to
withdraw circuit until it's just above window then, if you have time,
place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner
cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return,
secure trach w/ 4-point sutures & Velcro trach tie.

Angioedema
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Look for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema. Always scope to
r/o airway edema.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Labs: get complement protein C4 levels and C1-INH (low levels
-\> suspect C1 esterase deficiency). Also get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP,
ESR
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Causes: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Time frame:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>
Histamine related - comes & goes within 12 hours
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lisinopril related -- can take 2 days for swelling to
decrease
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hereditary angioedema -- can take DAYS
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If hereditary angioedema, can consider:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>
Purified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or
Ruconest).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ecallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Icatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise
admit to MICU overnight for airway monitoring and rescope in
morning
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Have a game plan for intubation -- speak to Anesthesia to notify
that patient is being admitted, provide plan for intubation,
nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.

Ear Foreign Body
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Always ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with
tuning fork exam

</li>
<li>
<p>
Ask the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan)
is rarely enough
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Get a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it
behind the foreign body and pop it out
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid
putting in drops as this could cause the foreign body to swell

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="fish-bone">
Fish Bone
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Do a fiberoptic exam. If you can't see it, offer a thin-cut CT
w/o contrast through the larynx
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4%
lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb
the posterior oropharynx
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill
forceps
</p>

<li>
<p>
Have a nurse wrap patient's tongue with gauze and pull it out to
improve access.
