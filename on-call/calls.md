# Calls

## Post-tonsillectomy patients

* **Bleeding:** Ask all tonsil bleeds to go to an ED. If sounds like a large active bleed, they go to the nearest ED, otherwise they come to us.
* **Fever:** Fever is expected for up to 2 weeks. If fever continues, can consider course of azithromycin (sometimes adenoid bed can become infected)
* **Neck Pain:** A small amount of neck pain is expected (typically from suspension or the adenoidectomy). If the patient cannot move their neck, send patient to ED for CT to r/o Grisel’s syndrome (especially if patient has down syndrome)
* **Pain:** check if patient has been able to receive pain meds (often parents can’t get kids to drink the meds). Offer PR Tylenol to help catch up pain
