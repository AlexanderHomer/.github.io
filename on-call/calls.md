Can I use my CPAP post-op -- No (especially if cosmetic or
osteotomies are performed since mask sits on nose + packing is in nose).
May be able to start after packing removed at 1-week post-op check

up or discuss with sleep specialist

needed -- just try and take them off for small periods of time.
