Proliferation: Enlarge to about 80% final size by 12months (rarely grows after 12months)
```{=html}

```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}

```
Get cardiac u/s & Head MRI to r/o posterior cranial fossa abnormalities. Possible risk of subglottic hemangiomas (do DLB if any respiratory symptoms)
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}
<li>
```
Treatment: Propanolol: during proliferative phase (aka under 1yo)
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}

```
Make sure no cardiac issues and \>5weeks old: consider in-hospital if high risk (concurrent diagnoses, airway symptoms), monitor glucose.
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}
<li>
```
Dose: Start 0.5mg/kg/day (divided into 2-3x/day dosing). Give 1`<sup>`{=html}st`</sup>`{=html} dose in office. Monitor vitals for 2 hours and check blood sugar. Advance dose by 0.5mg/kg/dose q4days to 2 mg/kg/day as tolerated (many ppl have patients come back when increasing dose to monitor for another 2 hours). Stop after 12 month old (taper over 4 weeks). Stop if patient has illness (n/v) or wheezing from a cold. Once illness has resolved, can resume treatment
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}

```
Superficial: can be treated with Pulse dye laser (PDL)
