Otology - Clinic Guide


#### 
Sillman/Noonan Clinic



- 

Use the new patient or follow up visit templates for the physician exam



- 

For the ear exam: use the microscope. Put "Microscopic exam in the ear section"



- 

For vertigo patients: do dix-hallpike, head thrust, rhomberg, Fukuda stepping tests +/- checking vibratory sensation, finger to nose prn





- 

Assessments in the assessment/problem section with the ICD-9 codes



- 

Keep the plans short. Put a plan for each problem listed.



- 

![](media/image3.png)including discussions regarding dry ear precautions. Put observation if no specific plan was proposed





- 

Put in the Attestation template and replace the \*\*\* with your name



- 

Under follow up, put the time frame + "sooner prn." Do NOT press done




### 
Audiology



- 

**PTA (pure tone)**: Hearing sensitivity at 500,1000,2000Hz



- 

**SRT** - lowest threshold **spondee** can be repeated 50% of time



- 

**WRS (word rec)** - % correct of a 50 word list of monosyllabic phonetically balanced words. Given at 40dB greater than SRT



- 

**Hearing loss levels:** go down by 15dB starting at \
#### 
Audiogram Patterns



- 

**2kHz notch** (air-bone) otosclerosis



- 

**4kHz notch** (SNHL) - noise exposure



- 

**Cookie bite** -- hereditary



- 

**Low Frequency** (SNHL) --- Meniere's




#### 
Tympanometry


**

**Ad = D**eep for **d**iscontinuity



As= **s**hallow for oto**s**clerosis /ossicular fixation



B + volume wnl: OME



B + large volume: perforation



C: ETD, retraction



#### 
Acoustic Reflex Testing



Image to the right are common patterns (Red = absent. Green = present)



**Right/Left**: the side of the sound stimulus.



**Ipsilateral/Contralateral**: side that the reflect stimulus is detected.



**Note**: Acoustic reflexes should be absent in CHL (otosclerosis etc) unless patients have semicircular canal dehiscence.



**OAEs**: T**EOAE - newborn testing.** DPOAE - think double tones (2 pure-tone freq.) DPOAE are good f or screening ototoxicity/noise toxicity



**ECoG**: Basically measuring Wave I on a ABR. The big thing to know is **\>0.45 SP/AP** is associated with **Meniere's**



**ABR**: **Wave V latency** (\>0.2ms) due to retrocochlear pathology



- 

Abnormal wave I-V and III-V latency = CHL




## 
Neuro-otology Imaging



**CT Temporal Bone**:



**Stenvers/Perpendicular** view: a long-axis projection of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, perpendicular to axis of cochlear (best for seeing cochlear implant electrode array) and is used to depict the **round** window, **tegmen**, as well as other structures.



The **Poschl/Parallel** view, a short-axis view of the petrous pyramid, was used to optimally visualize the **superior semicircular canal**


#### 
How to Read Temporal Bone Images



**Divide into:** EAC, Middle Ear, Inner Ear, Petrous Apex, Intratemporal Facial Nerve



**External Auditory Canal (EAC):**



- 

Necrotizing otitis externa: inflamed EAC and auricle w/ bony erosion of inferior EAC. T1 w/ contrast: cellulitis enhances. Same with T2



- 

Cholesteatoma: eroding mass in inferior, posterior EAC. MRI shows T1 iso/hypointense.T2 intermediate/high intensity. DWI is bright (aka restricted)



- 

Keratosis Obturans does not have bony destruction



- 

Exostoses (swimmers ears): typically at suture lines and are bilateral.



- 

Osteomas: Typically ovoid \1.5mm. Look for Mondini malformation: think Pendred's

#### 
Physical exam for Vertigo



- 

Test hearing with tuning forks



- 

Test cranial nerves



- 

Nystagmus: **nystagmus named in direction of fast phase**



- 

Does fixation help the vertigo (test by removing fixation: frenzel googles. Turning off lights, asking pt to close eyes)



- 

Gets worse when looking to the side of the lesion



- 

Vertical nystagmus = central





- 

Smooth pursuit: if patient cant track eyes smoothly: CNS pathology



- 

Test vestibulospinal reflex: Fukuda stepping test/Romberg



- 

Check for BPPV:



- 

**Dix Hallpike**: have head turned to one side then drop patient flat with head hanging slightly backwards. Repeat for both sides. Rotatory nystagmus occurs on the side of the lesion. Posterior SCC most common site



- 

**Head-shake test:**






**

Ask patient to close eyes then shake head (lateral rotation left and right) twice a second (2Hz) for 15-20 seconds. Ask them to open eyes. **Fast phase = towards lesion**




- 

**Head Impulse test/Head Trust**




**

Hold head and quickly rotate it toward one ear while patient fixates on your nose. If their eyes don't stay locked on you, patient has lesion on the side you rotate them towards




- 

**Oscillopsia test**: a quick test to evaluate for bilateral vestibular loss: Have patient do a head shake test while reading a snellen chart. If visual acuity significantly different than at rest, suspect b/l vestibular dysfunction





Additional testing



![](media/image6.png)**VNG/ENG**: If you have a nystagmus graph. Use ur arms to determine which side. Ur left arm can be parallel to left sided slow beating.


#### 
Caloric Testing



- 

Normal nystagmus response: Cold Opposite Warm Same (COWS)



- 

It's the only test for horizontal SCC. Test works by comparing sides. Can't detect bilateral lesions - will need rotary chair for this)



- 

Interpreting results



- 

Unilateral weakness (UW): UW \>25-30% = abnormal



- 

Directional preponderamce (DP): classic teaching is that DP \>30% = signficiant



- 

DP towards central lesion/away from peripheral lesion








#### 
Rotary Chair



- 

Used to determine bilateral vestibular impairment (aminoglycoside toxicity)



- 

Gain: normal is 1, decreased in acute peripheral disease, normalizes with time



- 

If gain is still abnormal, patient would benefit from vestibular rehab





- 

Phase lead - exaggerated in peripheral disease







**VEMP** (cervical to SCM)



- 

cVEMP evaluates saccule (vertical acceleration) -\> inferior vestibular nerve



- 

oVEMP evaluates utricle (horizontal acceleration) -\> superior vestibular nerve



- 

Unilateral decreased **amplitude** - peripheral lesion



- 

Decreased **threshold** - SCC dehiscence or perilymph fistula



- 

Increased **threshold** - middle ear pathology or ossicular chain abnormalities




#### 
Other



- 

**vHIT**: basically a recorded head impulse test



- 

**Computer Dynamic Posturography**: expensive test to test proprioception




#### 
Vignettes



- 

Down beating nystagmus with lateral gaze- Arnold chiari malformation (low medulla lesion)



- 

Bilateral INO lesions- lag dysmetria with lateral gaze. This is MS.




### 
Causes of Vertigo


#### 
Perilymph Fistula



-sudden SNHL w/ vertigo s/p trauma



-Tullio's phenomenon (vertigo w/ loud sound) Hennebert's sign: (vertigo w/ pneumatoscopy)



-Tx: bedrest, stool softeners, avoid straining


#### 
Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence



-vertigo, autophony, Tullio's & Hennebert's sign, aural fullness



-Audiogram: CHL, supernormal bone conduction. cVEMP (↓threshold, ↑amplitude), **acoustic reflexes are present**



-CT Temporal Bone: Get Porshl's view



-r/o otosclerosis with acoustic reflexes (otosclerosis: reflexes would be negative)


#### 
BPPV - Clinical Practice Guideline



-Dix-Hallpike: offending side=side closer to the ground. Nystagmus: geotropic (posterior SCC BPPV). If strong hx & neg dix-hallpike. Consider Lateral SCC BPPV and perform supine test



-Assess patient's home safety/risk of falling + ability to perform Epley



\-**No** i**maging or vestibular testing or vestibular suppressants** for those who have symptoms+exam findings of BPPV



-Can offer observation, vestibular rehab, or Epley maneuver: Dix hall pike to the offending side. Wait for nystagmus to stop, rotate head to contralateral side. **Hold head** and ask patient to rotate onto stomach, then have them tuck heels to bum and sit up. **Repeat** until nystagmus is gone



-can do Semont maneuver. Ask patient to keep head elevated for 48hours.



-patients w/ migraines and motion refractory take longer to recover. F/u in 4-6 weeks. If refractory, send to neurology to r/o migraines and get MRI to r/o retrocochlear pathology.



-surgery Tx: singular Neuroectomy (historic) posterior SCC occlusion (pack Posterior SCC with bone wax)


#### 
Meniere's Disease



Symptoms (Tetrad): FATE: Fluctuating SNHL (low-mid frequency), aural fullness, tinnitus, episodic vertigo. Typically unilateral. Bilateral in 25%. Can have sudden loss of consciousness or drop attacks (Crisis of Tumarkin).



Dx: Audiogram & ECoG: SP/AP \>0.35



Tx: restrict salt intake \6weeks of persistent OE.



-first try **mineral oil** 2-3 drops at night. F/U in 2 months



-next can try **DermOtic** (fluocinolone) if that doesn't work


#### 
Fungal Otitis External (Otomycosis)



MCC: aspergillus. Exam shows sheets of keratin with black conidophores on top of white filamentous hyphae. Tx: acetic acid (vinegar) vs c**lotrimazole 1% solution (lotrimin)**, glucose control, dry ear precautions. Consider gentian violet or methyl-cresyl actate for refractors cases


### 
Tinnitus-**Clinical Practice Guideline**




- definitely get audiogram for tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (\>6months) or associated with hearing loss. Note: Dr. Sillman says every tinnitus patient should get an audiogram as they often have high-tone SNHL (if hearing loss, can recommend hearing aids)
  

  
  -In general, don't get imaging. Only get imaging if tinnitus + either unilateral/asymmetric hearing loss or neurological abnormalities
  

  
  -Tx: can observe for bothersome tinnitus that has lasted for \6months) guideline recommends: **sound therapy** (white noise machine), **cognitive behavior therapy**, and **hearing aids** (ONLY IF patients have hearing loss). Guideline recommend against: dietary supplements, deep-brain stimulation, medical therapy. Dr Sillman also likely to recommend meditation.
  

  ### 
  Otosclerosis
  

  
  - 
  
  Ask: Progressive CHL beginning in 20-40yo. Strong family history (**Autosomal Dominant w/ incomplete penetrance)**. Often have tinnitus. Hear better in noise
  

  
  - 
  
  Exam: Schwartze sign (red hue behind TM). Audiogram: look for Carharts notch @ 2kHz (CO2: Carhart notch in Otosclerosis at 2Khz). Absent acoustic reflex. Shallow tympanometry (As: for Otosclerosis)
  

  
  - 
  
  DDx: SSCD (has present acoustic reflexes). Congenital stapes fixation (CHl since birth), Ossicular fixation (2/2 tympanosclerosis: presents w/ same findings/audiogram -- hard to differentiate), Paget's disease/Osteopetrosis (imaging is different)
  

  
  - 
  
  Tx: hearing aids or stapedectomy (criteria for stapedectomy: 25dB air-bone gap) w/ good bone line, good word rec)
  

  
  - 
  
  Stapedectomy: things to check:
  

  
  - 
  
  Only 1 good ear = contraindication. If both ears are bad: initial surgery on poorer ear
  

  
  - 
  
  Check CT for:
  

  
  - 
  
  Widened IAC: associated w/ stapes gusher
  

  
  - 
  
  Check for middle meningeal artery: patients may have persistent stapedial artery.
  

  
  
  
  
  
  - 
  
  Floating footplate: if footplate becomes mobile after stapes superstructure removed
  

  
  - 
  
  If retrievable, remove. If non-retrievable: abort and wait for plate to refix
  

  
  
  
  
  ### 
  Facial Nerve
  

  
  **Intracranial segment**: gives of Nervus intermedius -- contributes to GSPN and chorda tympani -\> **meatal**: through IAC to fundus -\> **labyrinthine**: shortest segment -- goes to geniculate ganglion and gives of GSPN \[gives off pregang. Parasymp to lacrimal gland\] -\> **tympanic** : goes inferior to HSCC & above oval window/stapes (which is why you down-fracture stapes) -\> mastoid segment
  

  
  **Management of FN paralysis**:
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBI**-**V (Day 0-14)**: Give 14 day course of prednisone and have them f/u within 1 week. If progressed to HBVI at f/u, get a ENoG,
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBVI (Day 0-3):** Give 14 day course of prednisone, f/u within 1 week
  

  
  - 
  
  **HBVI (Day3-14)**: Get ENoG. If \>90% degeneration: Get EMG: decompress nerve if EMG is negative, observe if positive. If \30db in 3 consecutive frequencies
  

  
  - 
  Clinician's should exclude CHL
  
  - 
  Assess for modifying factors: check for bilateral SNHL, recurrent episodes, associated vertigo or eye symptoms or focal defects
  
  - 
  Do not order CT head/brain for presumptive SSNHL.
  
  - 
  Obtain audiogram to confirm diagnosis
  
  - 
  Do not obtain lab testing
  
  - 
  We SHOULD r/o retrocochlear pathology w/ MRI, ABR, or audio followup
  
  - 
  Counsel patients on natural history of idiopathic SSNHL:
  
  \~1/3 to 2/3 of patients recover some function within 2 weeks.
  

  
  If no return of hearing within 2 weeks, less likely to recover
  

  
  - 
  Can (but not required) initiate steroid treatment (prednisone 1mg/kg/d (max 60mg/d), methylprednisone 48mg/d or decadron 10mg/d) for 7-14 days then taper over similar time. Offer up to 6 weeks out.
  
  - 
  Can give hyperbaric oxygen therapy within 3 months of disease
  
  - 
  Don't give any other meds (antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, antioxidants)
  
  - 
  Can offer intratympanic steroids for those who fail initial therapy"
  
  - 
  Decadron: 24mg/mL or 16mg/mL (compound) or 10mg/mL (stock)
  
  - 
  Methylprednisolone: 30-40mg/mL
  
  - 
  Inject 0.4-0.8mL into middle ear q3-7 days for 3-4 sessions. Keep head and affected ear up for 15-30mins after injection
  
  - 
  Repeat audio in 6 months
  
  - 
  If no improvement, should offer hearing aids

  - 
  
  Remove the OR bed's pad under head and place yellow gel + towels. Keep ear the same height as shoulder.
  

  
  - 
  
  Always balance the microscope and make sure the teaching oculars are on the ipsilateral side of the operating ear, and the oculars are "zeroed"
  

  
  - 
  
  NIM monitor for all mastoids
  

  
  - 
  
  Bien Air drill (Large 3L normal saline bags are used if using midas rex drill)
  

  
  - 
  
  Turn 180 degrees
  

  
  - 
  
  6,4 cutter, 3,2,1 diamond
  

  
  - 
  
  10% betadine
  

  
  - 
  
  Facial nerve leads: Orbicularis oris (in nasolabial fold next to nose pointing down) to get zygomaticus and orbicularis, and orbicularis oculi (just above lateral eyebrow pointing down and lateral) to get frontal and orbicularis
  

  
  - 
  
  For the hair, use mupirocin to keep it out of your way
  

  
  - 
  
  No thousand drapes. Blue towels start shoulder, posterior, superior, anterior. Staple
  

  
  - 
  
  Need crani drape. Direct the head of the little man to surgeon side.
  

  
  - 
  
  Drape microscope: don't connect the lens first- do last. Put hand pieces in first.
  

  
  - 
  
  Incision 1cm behind postauricular crease. Then switch to bovie down to TPF. Find temporal line and do a vertical incision then a horizontal one (T-shaped) through TPF to the bone. Use Joseph periosteal to expose mastoid. Harvests TPF if graft is needed
  

  
  - 
  
  **Postop**: f/u 2 weeks, glasscock/cotton in ear x2 days (remove POD#2), 1 week antibiotics (Augmentin preferred), drops start POD#2, bacitracin x1 week. No Narcotics.
  

  
  
  ### 
  Dr. Noonan's Tympanomastoidectomy
  

  
  - 
  
  Similar to Dr. Sillman's but does not remove the OR bed's pad under the head
  

  
  - 
  
  Have a shaver
  

  
  - 
  
  Use mastisol and place 2 halves of the 1020 drapes around the surgical ear
  

  
  - 
  
  Inject 10cc lido with epi off the field for post auricular incision, have 3 cc of 1:10,000 epi alone on the field for canal injections.
  

  
  - 
  
  Harvests TPF and TF if graft is needed

  Temporal Bone Lab
  

  
  **Location**: 4^th^ floor of the Boston Dispensary. Get a key made
  

  
  **Temporal Bone Harvest**: At the end of the MD and PA anatomy courses in March/April. Speak to Michael Doyle at Tufts
  

  
  Set up your station according to the House Dissection Manuel
  

  
  **Steps to a Mastoidectomy / Cochlear implant:**
  

  
  - 
  
  Get a 6 cutting burr: Drill out Trotman's triangle (temporal line, parallel to EAC, and sigmoid)
  

  
  - 
  
  Always keep the corner of the EAC/Temporal line as your deepest point and saucerize.
  

  
  - 
  
  Get your exposure:
  

  
  - 
  
  Make sure you hug the tegmen -- the tegmen is the roof of the mastoid antrum and will lead you directly to it.
  

  
  - 
  
  Thin the posterior EAC (put your suction into the EAC and really thin it out)
  

  
  - 
  
  Get through Koerner's Septum → you should enter the antrum and see Lateral SCC.
  

  
  - 
  
  Switch to 3 cutting burr: Drill away the inferior/anterior part of the antrum until you see the fossa incus (and the reflection of the incus) The incus points to the facial recess
  

  
  - 
  
  Thin the posterior EAC some more
  

  
  - 
  
  Switch to a 2 coarse diamond: start drilling the facial recess. There are some air cells above the facial recess (sentinel cells). Show yourself the cochlear. Practice a cochleostomy with a 1 fine diamond burr
