    "content": "\nCalls\nPost-tonsillectomy patients\n\nBleeding: Ask all tonsil bleeds to go to an ED. If sounds like a large active bleed, they go to the nearest ED, otherwise they come to us.\nFever: Fever is expected for up to 2 weeks. If fever continues, can consider course of azithromycin (sometimes adenoid bed can become infected)\nNeck Pain: A small amount of neck pain is expected (typically from suspension or the adenoidectomy). If the patient cannot move their neck, send patient to ED for CT to r/o Grisel\u2019s syndrome (especially if patient has down syndrome)\nPain: check if patient has been able to receive pain meds (often parents can\u2019t get kids to drink the meds). Offer PR Tylenol to help catch up pain\n\nPost Septorhinoplasty Q&amp;A\n\nDuration of swelling/bruising: 7-10days. Ways to reduce: sit up, apply ice\nWhen can I blow nose? gentile blowing starts 1-week post-op\nWhen should nasal drainage stop? 2-3 days postop\nWhen can I resume sports: light exercise 2-3 weeks. Sports where nose could be injured (ball-sports/contact sports) 3 months.\nWhen does nasal fullness/congestion subside? few weeks to a month\nWhen can I return to work? Probably 1 week. Sooner if they are up to it but need to take it easy w/ lifting and moving\nCan I use my CPAP post-op? No (especially if cosmetic or osteotomies are performed since mask sits on nose + packing is in nose). May be able to start after packing removed at 1-week post-op check (Dr. Lee is typically okay once packing comes out). Tell patients to sit up or discuss with sleep specialist\nWhen can I wear sunglasses? Can wear them over splint. Once splint comes off, if possible, try and avoid glasses on bridge of nose for another 1 week (especially if osteotomies done) but can wear them if needed \u2013 just try and take them off for small periods of time.\nWhen can I fly? 2-3 weeks post-op\n\nPost-Ear Surgery Restrictions\n\nGlasscock dressing: 1-2 days\nFor Dr. Sillman: Glasscock/cotton bud in ear is removed after 2 days, then ear drops started\nSinus precautions: 2 weeks\nRestrictions on flying: 2-3 weeks\nRestriction on scuba diving: for stapedectomy - forever\nDry ear precautions: 6 weeks\n\nSinus Surgery Restrictions\n\nSinus precautions for 2-3 weeks\nAvoid flying for 2-3 weeks\n\nTravel Restrictions:\n\nAvoid flying for:\nSinus surgery or septorhinoplasty \u2014 2-3 weeks\nEar surgery (except tubes) \u2014 2-3 weeks\nStapedectomy \u2014 2 weeks for Dr. Sillman (6-8 weeks: most other Otologists)\nAvoid travelling far from hospital\n\n\nTonsillectomies: 2 weeks\n\nPost-Op Precautions\nDry ear precautions\n\nBefore showering, coat a small piece of cotton with a tablespoon of Vaseline ointment. Gently insert the cotton ball into the ear canal and keep in for the duration of the shower.\nIf swimming or bathing is desired, purchase earplugs and a headband to keep earplugs from falling out.\n\nSinus Precautions\n\nBlowing your nose: Do not pinch your nose: do not blow your nose. You can gently wipe your nose if needed.\nSneezing: If you must sneeze, keep your mouth open and do not pinch your nose closed.\nSucking in air/liquid: Do not drink though a straw. Do not smoke.\nBlowing out air: Do not play a wind instrument. Do not blow up balloons.\nPushing or lifting: Do not lift or push objects weighing more than 20 pounds. Avoid strenuous activity. Please use soft softeners.\nBending over: Keep your head above the level of your heart. Sleep with your head slightly raised\n\nBack to homepage"

    "title": "Consults",
    "content": "\nConsults\nEpistaxis\n\nMost bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.\nCheck for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry environment, cocaine use. Check the BP, coags, platelets. Find out which side the bleed started\nBring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope, phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel, Surgifoam, Bactroban, ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 &amp; #9 Frazier tip suction, silver nitrate cautery.\nCan bring thrombigel or ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you want to get fancy\nThink posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the maxillary sinus)\nFor posterior bleeds, can use:\n10F Foley \u2013 Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/ 10cc, pull until balloon wedges against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal alar. Monitor for palate necrosis\nEpistat \u2013 put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with 7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw until balloon wedges against posterior nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.\nAnt/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) \u2013 works well. Inflate until the patient can\u2019t tolerate it anymore\nRule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires hospital admission and pulse ox monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia you are monitoring for)\nIt\u2019s never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both sides, take at least one of them out.\nED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is coming from and why it is happening. Find the bleeding source\n\n\u2022   Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming from.\n\nIf its anterior and a vessel can be seen, use a silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop down onto patients\u2019 lips and discolor their skin.\nIf its further back (mid septum), wrap surgicel around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and press it against the area that\u2019s bleeding.\nIf it\u2019s posterior: use a posterior pack. Pumping vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.\nIf it\u2019s an HHT patient. Surgiflo seems to work best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with it.\n\nPTAs\n\nCBC w/ Diff; Rapid Strep; Monospot\nDecadron 10 mg IV x 1 (only if drained or neg needle aspiration + neg CT for abscess;\nUnasyn IV or Clindamycin (PCN allergic) x1 only if CBC shows no atypical lymphocytes &amp; monospot is negative; then continue PO x 7-14 days\nTo Drain: yankeur suction at bedside, 18-gauge needle, &gt;27-gauge needle, 10 mL syringe, 5 mL syringe, lidocaine with epi, tongue depressor, 15 blade, Kelly clamp, hurricane spray\nHurricane spray -&gt; lido w/ epi -&gt; You can needle aspirate to localize the region. March down the side of the peritonsillar space, it can be lower than you think. When you strike gold, send it for culture, then do an I&amp;D w/ a #15 blade and spread with clamp.\nLow threshold to scope (unless you have a CT) to clear the airway as edema can track down\n\nTracheostomy\n\n\nFamily discussion completed by primary team (you aren\u2019t responsible for that talk)\n\n\nCoagulation\n\nPlatelet, H/H, INR/PTT\nAnticoagulation (why? Can it be shut off) \u2013 lovenox stop 24hrs before, heparin gtt 4-5 hours before - see anticoagulation guide\nIntubation hx (PEEP (PEEP &gt;8 makes trachs much more difficult \u2013 pts quickly desat, trach has higher risk of dislodging) duration, traumatic? Tube size? Extubation attempts, exposure)\nOperative Steps: Place shoulder roll. mark out midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep &amp; drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don\u2019t open to wide (you\u2019ll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3rd tracheal rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff, put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by making two horizontal incisions over 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to withdraw circuit until it\u2019s just above window then, if you have time, place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return, secure trach w/ 4-point sutures &amp; Velcro trach tie.\n\nAngioedema\n\nLook for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema.\nAlways scope to r/o airway edema.\nLabs: get complement protein, C4 levels, and C1-INH (low levels -&gt; suspect C1 esterase deficiency).\nAlso get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP, ESR\nCauses: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs\nTime frame: Histamine related - comes &amp; goes within 12 hours\nLisinopril related \u2013 can take 2 days for swelling to decrease\nHereditary angioedema \u2013 can take DAYS\nRec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.\n\nIf hereditary angioedema, can consider:\n\nPurified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest).\nEcallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)\nIcatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist\nIf significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise admit to MICU overnight for airway monitoring and rescope in morning\nHave a game plan for intubation \u2013 speak to Anesthesia to notify that patient is being admitted, provide plan for intubation, nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.\n\n\n\nParotitis/Sialadenitis\n\nMASH: Massage, antibiotics, sialagogues (lemon drops, orange wedges), hydration/heat.\n\nEar Foreign Body\n\nAlways ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with tuning fork exam\nAsk the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan) is rarely enough\nGet a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it behind the foreign body and pop it out\nIf the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid putting in drops as this could cause the foreign body to swell\n\nFish Bone\n\nDo a fiberoptic exam. If you can\u2019t see it, offer a thin-cut CT w/o contrast through the larynx\nIf fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4% lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb the posterior oropharynx\nUse the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill forceps\nHave a nurse wrap patient\u2019s tongue with gauze and pull it out to improve access.\nFor children, it\u2019s often easier to go to the OR.\n\nOrbital Cellulitis\n\n\nPreseptal vs Orbital Cellulitis:\n\n\nOrbital cellulitis is likely to have chemosis, pain with EOMI, restricted eye movement\n\n\nWhen to drain a subperiosteal abscess? \n\n\nIf the abscess volume is &lt;1250mm3 can avoid OR (measure abscess in 3 dimensions WxDxL in mm)\n\n\nHow to tell if there is a cavernous sinus thrombosis: get a MRI with contrast.\n\n\nLook at DTI/DWI (isoDTI) - if the Cavernous sinus lights up, strong indication for Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Look for edema. If in the vessels, think of thrombophlebitis.\n\nRule out shine through.  ADC map (dDTI) should be the opposite of the DWI (isoDTI) if it\u2019s true. If they are the same, this is shine through effect.\n\n\nOn T1 post contrast - look for filling defect. Then confirm on DWI.\n1-2mm should be size of superior ophthalmic vein. Expect it to be dilated on both sides\n\n\n\nAirway patients with stridor\n\nAsk: onset of stridor + speed of progression. Eval for infectious vs inflammatory vs foreign body vs neoplastic\nEvaluate: O2 sat, respiratory rate, retractions, ability to lay supine. Stridor: insp: supraglottic/glottic. Biphasic: glottic/subglottic. Expiratory: trachea/bronchi. Perform fiberoptic exam and check airway\n\nManagement:\n\n\nAirway widely patent and mild edema, slow progression of symptoms \u2192 observation on floor w/ O2 monitoring\n\nAirway patent but moderate edema (e.g. angioedema patients) \u2192 observation in ICU\nUnable to entire airway \u2192 OR for awake fiberoptic intubation w/ possible awake trach\nUnable to see any airway \u2192 OR for awake trach\n\n==Surgical Airway Patients==\n\n\nAlert an attending\n\nNasal trumpet, Heliox if increased WOB\nBag Mask (may not be the best) or LMA\nIf stable, perform fiberoptic exam. If intubation needed, try and do in OR\n\nPediatric Stridor\n\nScope with nursing and bag mask equipment available. Always ask the NICU RN before you even touch a kid in the NICU\nWhen you scope, scope around the nasal cannula, don\u2019t remove it\nNo reflux medications in NICU babies unless the attending clears it (causes NEC)\n\nDDX:\n\n\nLaryngomalacia\n\nVF immobility: see VF immobility workup in Pedi ENT section\nComplete tracheal rings\nGet echo, head u/s +/- MRI\nMBS if VF immobility\nLow threshold for DLB\n\n\n\nTransfers\n\nNever accept an unstable transfer.\nNo direct admits unless one of our attendings has accepted it. In general, transfers go through the ED\n\nAdmissions from ED\nIn general, we have adopted the same model as Orthopedics.\n\nAdmit to Medicine with ENT consult: Adults with non-surgical issue (peritonsillar phlegmon, angioedema) or surgical issue + multiple co-morbidities (taking medications for T2DM and HTN) or is high risk (history of MI)\nAdmit to ENT: Adults with non-complicated surgical patients (e.g.: retropharyngeal abscess) and those with post-op complications (unless it is purely medical e.g. poor PO intake, pain control etc.).\nAdmit to Pediatrics: Typically, all pediatric patients except those with post-surgical complications go to Pediatrics\n\nGeneral rule: Be reasonable. Medicine are reasonable\u2026which means they tend to get dumped on a lot. We should take the simple patients onto our service. At the same time, recognize that we are in the ORs during the day and are home-call at night so don\u2019t have the manpower to manage difficult patients.\nInpatient or bedded outpatient patients who had surgery: they come to our service."

    "content": "\nRules of the Game\nThe goal of residency is avoiding phone calls and avoiding pages\nBuild your differential: mistakes happen when you prematurely close on a diagnosis. R/O the worst-case scenarios\nNever make assumptions.\nIf you delegate work, you are still responsible for following up on the result\nEscalate any clinical changes in a patient to a senior resident or attending. This is not just to CYA but to avoid mistakes. Two eyes are better than one\nText out to the other residents for any consults, new ED or post-op admissions.\nEveryone\u2019s time is valuable. No matter what level of training you are, no job is above or beneath you. Don\u2019t ask others to do your busy work. No-one is going to clean up your mess.\nHelp the PGY-2. It\u2019s a small service so if anyone isn\u2019t pulling their weight things fall apart.\u00a0 We are our own checks and balances.\nTeach\u2013 you have an obligation to pass on your knowledge to the residents, interns, and medical students under you. If you present, make sure you give people 3-4 take away points.\nBe prepared for every case \u2013 pretend there is no attending with you.\nWhen you present to an attending, give just the meat \u2013 tell them what symptoms the patient has before telling them what the patient doesn\u2019t have**.**\nDon\u2019t miss didactics. The service as a team must protect this time.\nTemporal bones don\u2019t drill themselves \u2013 but they want to be drilled. Keep the temporal bone lab in good working order and harvest bones in the Spring\nTreat every day like a job interview \u2013 The attendings notice when you work hard and when you slack off. Ultimately, their opinion of you dictates your ability to get a job/match into a fellowship after residency.\nUpdate the guide: every time you think \u201cthis would be useful for the pocketbook,\u201d add it in. This doesn\u2019t update itself.\nTry and improve every aspect of our program. Everyone has to do their bit to leave this program better off than when you came.\nBack to homepage"

Inject methylene blue with the 30 gauge needle circumferentially. This MUST be in the dermal plane, as that\u2019s where the lymphatics are.\nYou should see the methylene blue splay underneath the skin.\nInject, prep, drape. This is generally not a full neck dissection. \\n This will usually be a 2\u20133cm incision, dissect to find the LN using the NeoProbe to check on location, and find the LN.\nFind the LN. Note, this may NOT appear like a pathologic LN. \\n This may be a subcentimeter LN that has some slight hypervascularity/blue tint.\nTest the LN on the back table.\nIf you have the right LN, the NeoProbe should register at the same level as before.\nTest the bed in which the LN came from.\nThe surrounding areas should not register more than 20% of the original high-registering value (some people say 10% of highest value).\nIf it does, there are more LN to get.\nClose.\n\nLee \u2013 Skin Grafting\n\nPrep out the thigh (usually right thigh) using Chlorhexidine. Try to find an area of the thigh that is most flat and without skin lesions. Drape using an upside down half sheet. Place a folded blue towel with a clamp on it over the prepped thigh. This ultimately gets covered with the over-drape, but the blue towel and clamp makes it easy to find when you\u2019re ready to take the skin graft.\nWhen it\u2019s time, feel the clamp, cut out the area with scissors. Staple the edges of the over-drape down.\nMeasure out the skin graft (extra 1-2 cm in both directions). Rub mineral oil over the thigh. We use mineral oil because (1) it will not become rancid and (2) it smooths the area for easy skin graft harvesting.\nPreparing the skin graft blade: for STSG, Dr. Lee likes to set it somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3 inches. You should be able to fit a flat 15-blade between the blade and the machine; this will give you a good split thickness skin graft width if you can\u2019t remember 0.2\u20130.3 or if you\u2019re using a different machine.\nChoose the width gauge that is roughly 1\u20132cm larger than what you need.\nPlace the skin graft machine on the thigh at an angle dictated by the side piece (there is a slight angle to the width gauge; roughly 20\u201330 degrees). Press relatively firmly and push forward. Use DeBakey\u2019s to grasp the skin graft.\nAgain, cut the graft so it is roughly 1\u20132cm longer than what you think you need. You do NOT need to mesh the graft. You will cut a few drainage holes in it once the graft is attached. You will likely bolster it down with cotton dipped in mineral oil wrapped in Xeroform, held down by silk ties. The skin graft site will be covered by a large Allevyn dressing, which stays there for one week.\n\nLee \u2013 Post Mohs Reconstruction\nFlap Types\n\n\nPivotal\n\n\nRotation: eg cervicofacial advancement, O-to-Z\n\nTranspositional: eg bilobed and rhombic\nInterpolation: base of flap bridges over tissue: eg paramedian\nIsland: eg V-to-Y island flap\n\nAdvancement\n\n\nUnipedicle. Eg mesolabial\n\nBilobed advancement\nV-to-Y advancement flap\n\n\nBEST LOCAL FLAP FOR LOCATION\n\nSCALP: STSG or rotation flapsA. &gt;6cm + partial thickness: STSGB. &lt;6cm: Consider O-T or O-Z flaps (this is because two rotation flaps are used in OT &amp; OZ flaps: Arc of scalp should be 4 times the diameter of defect)\nFOREHEAD\nMidline: Can close primarily in a vertical orientation (&lt;1cm).Dissect in subgaleal plane.\nParamedian/Lateral: do bilateral advancement flaps. Dissect in superficial plane to avoid supratrochlear/supraorbital nerves\nMEDIAL CHEEK\nAbove Ala: Transposition flaps (rhomboid) with lines in the melolabial/labial mandibular creases\n\nAt or below level of ala: V-to-Y island flap (imagine the defect is the base of a triangle and that the other two sides of the triangle close together).\n\nWidth of skin triangle = wide of defect at widest point. Have the length be TWICE length of defect. Have triangle in the direction of the mesolabial groove.\nUndermine 2 cm in all directions.\nCut all three limbs of triangle. Blood supply is from deep (at least 1/3 of skin island must have deep attachments. Cut defect to fit graft)\nLATERAL CHEEK\nSmall defects: transposition flap (rhomboid).\nLarge defects: rotation advancement flap (cervicofacial advancement)\nLIP\nCentral lip/philtrum: bilateral advancement flap with incision on vermillion border\nLateral lip: rotation flap. Not from medial cheek to maintain melolabial crease\nNOSE\nAnterior aspect of alar groove: island pedicle flap\nNasal tip or nasal dorsum/sidewall: bilobed flap (max for 1\u20131.5cm defects)\n\n\n"

To Decrease Tip Rotation:\n\nA. Trim caudal septum near spine\nB. Augment dorsum\n\nIX. To Decrease Bulbosity:\n\nTrim cephalic lateral crura\n\nX. To Narrow Tip:\n\nSuture medial crura or domes (interdomal stitch)\n\nXI. External Valve Collapse:\n\nUse alar batten graft\n\nComplications\nI. Rocker Deformity\n\nMedial osteotomy too high \u2192 re-do cephalic fracture lower on the nasal bone\nOsteotomies should be medial \u2192 lateral\n\nII. Inverted V / Open Roof\n\nDue to inadequate lateralization\nor incomplete osteotomy\nor if the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid is deviated\n\nIII. Polly-Beak (Late)\n\n\nA. Causes:\n\n\n(MCC) Inadequate dorsal hum reduction\n\nInadequate tip support (e.g. overresection of LLC)\nInadequate resection of anterior septal angle\nSupratip scar formation\nMost commonly due to under correction of cartilaginous dorsum (incomplete dorsal reduction), but can be overresection of lower lateral cartilages causing a loss of tip support. Worse in patients with thick skin or if tip deprojects due to scarFix with columella struts\n\nIV. Saddle Nose\n\nOver-resection of septum or failure to preserve L strut\n\nApproaches\nI. Endonasal\n\nIntercartilaginous: between ULC\u2013LLC\nTranscartilaginous: through LLC (to help narrow nasal tip)\nDelivery: Marginal incisions + intercartilaginous\n\nII.

Arm needs to\nrest on arm board, place sterile drape on arm board.\nPlace a towel around the armpit and use Edna to clip it. Then, wrap a\nsponge around the thumb to supinate the forearm and clip the sponge to\nthe arm board with an Edna.\nThen cover the arm with towel to keep sterile.\nDr.\u00a0Tracy will then wrap the arm with an elastic wrap to drain it off\nits venous supply. Then the tourniquet will be applied as a setting of\n250 and a timer for 1 hour starts.\nBegin by incising the lateral aspect of the skin paddle to find the\nCephalic vein which is preserved and follow it all the way up to the\nantecubital fossa. Next use forceps to find the vascular pedicle then\nyou can raise the flap on the contralateral side and isolate and tie off\nthe vascular pedicle and start lifting the flap\n\nDr.\u00a0O'Leary's\nThyroidectomy\nLaryngeal nerve monitoring tube is needed and the Medtronic NIM\nmonitor. No paralytics, and needs antibiotics. Watch anesthesia's\nglidescope to ensure that the blue stripe is adjacent to the vocal\ncords. Place the gel ax roll as the shoulder roll and recheck the tube\nplacement with the glidescope. Attach the nerve monitor consul at the\nhead of the bed and tape it in place. Ensure that the nerve monitor is\nworking appropriately by tapping in the neck. Mark the neck along a\nnerve crease if possible 2-3 cm above the sternal notch. Inject with 1%\nlidocaine with epi. Prep with betadine.\n\nDr.\u00a0Dhingra's Thyroidectomy\nInject incision in preop.\nMake generous incision 2 inches above the sternum then make the\nincision down past the platysma on both sides and use the Bovie to\ndevelop yourself sub-platysmal flaps. Use your finger as a come hither\nmotion to get them going and work a free edge. Go down to the sternum on\nthe inferior flap. Go up to the cricoid/thyroid notch superiorly.\nThen travel down midline kind of like you would do with a trach. Use\nkelly's to present the midline fascia for someone to divide with the\nbovie.\nKeep going making sure you're a midline until you come down to the\nthyroid. Be careful inferiorly because there is a plexus of vessels and\nbecome very vascular. Here use the ligasure to make sure you don't make\nanything bleed.\nOnce you found the thyroid then you want to work the sternothyroid\noff the thyroid to develop the lateral edge of the thyroid. To do this,\nget two peanuts: one using to retract the thyroid towards you and the\nother to push on the undersurface of the sternothyroid to elevate it\noff. Once you have enough of an edge, ask for the lady finger for\nsomeone to retract. Once you've developed the lateral edge, keep doing\nit up towards the superior pole. Here there are a lot of vessels so be\nsure to use the Ligasure.\nThis is the part to pay attention to: developing the superior pole is\nthe one of three or four critical steps. You should not look for the\nsuperior laryngeal nerve necessarily but you should be cognizant of the\ncricothyroid muscle.\nOnce you have freed the superior pole you can develop the middle a\nlittle bit more but don't get too deep/posterior. This is when you have\nto check to see where your current laryngeal nerve is remember the\ndifferent landmarks.\n\n\n\nLocated in simon's triangle: trachea, carotid, and inferior\nlobe.\n\n\n\nRLN is deep to berry's ligament\n\n\n\nTubercle of Zuckerkandl: RLN is medial to it. Superior thyroid is\nsuperior to it\n\n\n\nLeft RLN is more medial than right RLN. Left RLN is reliably deep\nto inferior thyroid a\n\n\n\nSuperior Parathyroid is posterior to RLN. Inferior parathyroid is\nanterior to RLN\nIn reality you're going to use a snit forcep spreading in the\ndirection of the nerve and using the stimulator. Once you found it\nfollow superiorly and inferiorly see that you are confident of the plane\ntypically people follow it all the way into its insertion.\nOnce you've done that you can free the rest of the middle and\ninferior pole of the thyroid and of the trachea. You can do this\nrelatively quickly as the nerve is protected. Once the thyroid only\nattached to the trachea, use a Kelly and spread along the trachea in the\nmidline superior to inferior (you can use a bovie to take it off the\ntrachea as well as the plane is pretty well developed). Then you can\ntransect half of it and do the otherside. Dump some thrombin soaked\nGelfoam into the resected area close the straps with 3-0 Vicryl. Close\nthe platysma with 4-0 Vicryl and close the wound with a subcuticular 5-0\nMonocryl.\n\nDr Wein Thyroidectomy\nSimilar set up to Dhingra's. When you lift the upper subplatysmal\nflap, roll skin over a wet 4x8 gauze and suture to mandible with 2-0\nsilk to retract it. Use 3 lone stars on lower flap. Split the straps.\nFree the middle of the thyroid. Use middle finger on gauze to retract\nthyroid towards you. Use a ladyfinger to retract straps. Bipolar through\nfascia. When you approach superior pole, hug gland. Dr Wein doesn't\nnecessarily go hunting for the nerve\n\nDr Wein INSPIRE Hypoglossal Nerve Implants\nSet Up:\n\n\n\nPatient rotated 180.

Enlarge w/ crying/straining. Associated w/ GLUT-1\n\n\nPhases\n\n\nProliferation: Enlarge to about 80% final size by 12months (rarely grows after 12months)\n\n\nInvolution: 50% regress by 5 years, 70% by 7years\n\n\nDiagnosis: MRI - high intensity T2, flow voids\n\n\nIf in beard distribution CNV: think PHACES (posterior fossa, hemangiomas, aorta/cardiac, seye, sternal pits) more common in females\n\n\nGet cardiac u/s &amp; Head MRI to r/o posterior cranial fossa abnormalities. Possible risk of subglottic hemangiomas (do DLB if any respiratory symptoms)\n\n\nTreatment: Propanolol: during proliferative phase (aka under 1yo)\n\n\nMake sure no cardiac issues and &gt;5weeks old: consider in-hospital if high risk (concurrent diagnoses, airway symptoms), monitor glucose.\n\n\nDose: Start 0.5mg/kg/day (divided into 2-3x/day dosing). Give 1^st^ dose in office. Monitor vitals for 2 hours and check blood sugar. Advance dose by 0.5mg/kg/dose q4days to 2 mg/kg/day as tolerated (many ppl have patients come back when increasing dose to monitor for another 2 hours). Stop after 12 month old (taper over 4 weeks). Stop if patient has illness (n/v) or wheezing from a cold. Once illness has resolved, can resume treatment\n\n\nSuperficial: can be treated with Pulse dye laser (PDL)\n\n\nSubglottic: Treat with CO2 laser resection\n\n\n\nCongenital Hemangiomas\n\n\nNot associated with GLUT-1. Typically fully formed at birth. Types:\n\n\nRapidly Involuting (RICH): disappear by 18month of age\n\n\nNon-involving (NICH): consider embolization and excision once child is school age\n\n\nKasabach-merrit dx:\n\n\nUnlike infantile hemangiomas - they do not spontaneously involute\n\n\nCause coagulopathy, bleeding risk\n\n\n\nLOW FLOW VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS\n\n\nCapillary Malformations: Presents with Port-Wine stain at birth. Associated with Sturge Weber syndrome: Can involve leptomeninges- risk of seizures, mental retardation. Treatment: Pulse Dye Laser\n\n\nVenous malformations: Commonly on the lips. Bluish hue. Can cause consumption coagulopathy. Imaging shows calcifications (phleboliths) because of low flow. Tx Sclerotherapy\n\n\nLymphatic Malformations\n\n\nMacrocystic &gt;2cm^2^. Microcystic \\&lt;2cm^2^\n\n\nStaging: suprahyoid worse than infrahyoid and bilateral is worse than unilateral\n\n\nLateral to lateral canthus---tend to be macrocytic. Medial = microcystic.\n\n\nSymptoms/Presentation: airway compression (often needs an EXIT procedure if detected in utereo). Painful if infected. Hemorrhage into cyst can cause rapid enlargement\n\n\nTreatment:\n\n\nSclerotherapy: 100% ethanol, OK-432, doxycycline, bleomycin, Sirolimus\n\n\nIf suprahyoid, may involve oral/mucosa look for airway swelling w/ therapy\n\n\nBest for Macrocystic stage I diseases (microcystic/bilateral is more resistant)\n\n\nMacrocystic posterior neck, infrahyoid, LMs without septations can be observed\n\n\nExcision if symptomatic (low recurrence if completely removed but should be conservative)\n\n\n\nHIGH FLOW --- ARTERIAL/ARTERIOVENOUS\n\n\nSmall in childhood then rapid growth with puberty.\n\n\nPatients have a bruit. Untreated, can have heart failure\n\n\nWorkup: Doppler, CTA. Tx: preop embolization and then resection\n\n\n\nMALIGNANT LESIONS\n\n\nLipomas: mobile\n\n\nNeurofibromas: Think family history of NF1 (Chr 17). Look for ocular symptoms (optic gliomas (astrocytomas); Lisch nodules (Hamartomas of iris), axillary/inguinal freckles.\n\n\nLymphoma: Hogkins is more common than NHL in the neck: HL = B-symptoms\n\n\nBack to homepage"

Don't allow the\nscrubs to open an actual microdebrider...for their sake.\nMake sure the cochlear instruments have these templates (Cochlear\nCorp)\nBalance the microscope. Don't drape it yet.\nCall audiology and give them\nthe serial numbers for the cochlear implants\nThings to put on the non-sterile side table:\nM&amp;T kit, mastisol, 1000 drapes cut in half (need 5-6), NIM\nelectrodes, tegederms cut in \u00bd, a razor, alcohol prep pads,\nlidocaine)\nSet up\nBed rotated 180 degrees.\nLeica microscope at head of bed, tower can be on the scrub side of\nmicroscope, NIM monitor and suction on the scrub side by the feet.\nDraw out the BTE template. Draw out the location of the implant using\nthe silicone template. This has to be above the temporal line and make\nthe angle that it sits &gt;45 degrees (Vecchiotti likes it more vertical\nthan usual) from the temporal line. Shave the hair by the proposed\nimplant site.\nDraw a lazy S incision 0.5cm behind the post-auricular crease.\nPlace the NIM and curl the\nleads before you stick the Tegaderm down. Test the monitor.

Raise\nsupraperiosteal flaps anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the EAC.\nCreate a palva flap -- use a bovie (if no contralateral implant\nplaced) down to the bone. Raise the flap with a Lempert periosteal\nelevator to the spine of henle.\nDo a cortical mastoidectomy,\nfocus on the corner where the tegmen and EAC meet. Use a #6 until you\nhit Koerner septum, then switch to a #3 to expose the lateral\nsemicircular canal, incus buttress and the fossa incudes. The incus\npoints to the facial recess. Use the facial nerve stimulator to get an\nidea where the facial nerve is, then take down the air cells on the EAC\n(your gonna take corda) to get through the facial recess. Expose round\nwindow. Drill part of your cochlostomy with a 1 diamond burr\nanterior/inferior to round window until you are about to pop through it\nthen stop.\nUse a freer to create your pocket (make it small/tight. He'll pimp\nyou on what is keeps the implant from moving. The answer is the\ntemporalis tendon blocks the anterior/inferior corner of the implant\nfrom migrating) Put the metal implant template on a Kelly and use that\nto dissect the pocket for a good fit. Use a pen to mark a line from the\nmetal template to the mastoid cavity and use a 3 cutting burr to drill a\nwell for the electrodes. Take some temporalis fascia for later\nIrrigate the mastoid. Ask for blue towels to put around the sterile\narea and change gloves. Open to the cochlear implant.

Hold the implant\nfin with AOS forceps and put the implant into the cochleostomy until you\nhit the Silastic stopper. Then advance the electrodes, stop if you feel\nresistance, until the white tabs line up. Pack the cochleostomy\nUse non-compressed gelfoam to pack the mastoid. Close palva flap with\nrunning 4-0 vicryl. Close deep layer with 4-0 vicyrl. Superficial with a\n5-0 fast absorbing plain gut, use dermabond over that. Use a kerlex for\nfluffs.

Associated w/ GLUT-1\n\n\nPhases\n\n\nProliferation: Enlarge to about 80% final size by 12months (rarely grows after 12months)\n\n\nInvolution: 50% regress by 5 years, 70% by 7years\n\n\nDiagnosis: MRI - high intensity T2, flow voids\n\n\nIf in beard distribution CNV: think PHACES (posterior fossa, hemangiomas, aorta/cardiac, seye, sternal pits) more common in females\n\n\nGet cardiac u/s &amp; Head MRI to r/o posterior cranial fossa abnormalities. Possible risk of subglottic hemangiomas (do DLB if any respiratory symptoms)\n\n\nTreatment: Propanolol: during proliferative phase (aka under 1yo)\n\n\nMake sure no cardiac issues and &gt;5weeks old: consider in-hospital if high risk (concurrent diagnoses, airway symptoms), monitor glucose.\n\n\nDose: Start 0.5mg/kg/day (divided into 2-3x/day dosing). Give 1^st^ dose in office. Monitor vitals for 2 hours and check blood sugar. Advance dose by 0.5mg/kg/dose q4days to 2 mg/kg/day as tolerated (many ppl have patients come back when increasing dose to monitor for another 2 hours). Stop after 12 month old (taper over 4 weeks). Stop if patient has illness (n/v) or wheezing from a cold. Once illness has resolved, can resume treatment\n\n\nSuperficial: can be treated with Pulse dye laser (PDL)\n\n\nSubglottic: Treat with CO2 laser resection\n\n\n\nCongenital Hemangiomas\n\n\nNot associated with GLUT-1. Typically fully formed at birth. Types:\n\n\nRapidly Involuting (RICH): disappear by 18month of age\n\n\nNon-involving (NICH): consider embolization and excision once child is school age\n\n\nKasabach-merrit dx:\n\n\nUnlike infantile hemangiomas - they do not spontaneously involute\n\n\nCause coagulopathy, bleeding risk\n\n\n\nLOW FLOW VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS\n\n\nCapillary Malformations: Presents with Port-Wine stain at birth. Associated with Sturge Weber syndrome: Can involve leptomeninges- risk of seizures, mental retardation. Treatment: Pulse Dye Laser\n\n\nVenous malformations: Commonly on the lips. Bluish hue. Can cause consumption coagulopathy. Imaging shows calcifications (phleboliths) because of low flow. Tx Sclerotherapy\n\n\nLymphatic Malformations\n\n\nMacrocystic &gt;2cm^2^.

Apply mastisol around your operative\nfield. Place the 1000 drapes on all 4 sides. Do a wide prep with\nbetadine. Put on headlight before you scrub. Have\nbipolar set on 10/10.\nCLOSING -- in general:\n\n\n\n4.0 vicryl for deep layers; buried interrupted\n\n\n\n5.0 or 6.0 fast absorbing gut for skin; simple running\n\n\n\n5.0 monocryl if closing skin with subcuticular stitches\n\n\n\nProlene if placing drain\n\n\n\nBacitracin ointment (occasionally dermabond)\nSistrunk (Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Excision)\nTechnique: see article Posterior Hyoid Space as Related to\nExcision of the Thyroglossal Duct Cyst John Maddalozzo, MD, FAAP,\nFACS, Jeremy Alderfer, MD; Vikash Modi, MD The Laryngoscope\n2010\n\nCochlear\nImplants (Vecchiotti)\nTo confirm before patient enters room\n\n**\n\nCheck the patient's ear in the pre-op area to r/o mucoid\neffusion.\nMake sure CPD have pulled the cochlear implant instruments kit (there\nis a special kit for each CI manufacturer), the ear kit, an M&amp;T kit,\nthe Paparella press (for tympmastoids) the Visao drill with a 6 cutting,\n3 cutting, 2 coarse diamond and 1 fine diamond drill on the field (a 1.5\nfine diamond off the field as well)\nMake sure they have the PURPLE permanent marker on the field (it's\nthe only one that draws on the Ioban)\nMake sure they have a NIM nerve stimulator (the one where you can\nchange the voltage) on the field\nA big bag of saline and big bag of sterile water handing on the\nirrigation machine (the one used for the microdebrider). Don't allow the\nscrubs to open an actual microdebrider...for their sake.\nMake sure the cochlear instruments have these templates (Cochlear\nCorp)\nBalance the microscope. Don't drape it yet.\nCall audiology and give them\nthe serial numbers for the cochlear implants\nThings to put on the non-sterile side table:\nM&amp;T kit, mastisol, 1000 drapes cut in half (need 5-6), NIM\nelectrodes, tegederms cut in \u00bd, a razor, alcohol prep pads,\nlidocaine)\nSet up\nBed rotated 180 degrees.\nLeica microscope at head of bed, tower can be on the scrub side of\nmicroscope, NIM monitor and suction on the scrub side by the feet.\nDraw out the BTE template. Draw out the location of the implant using\nthe silicone template. This has to be above the temporal line and make\nthe angle that it sits &gt;45 degrees (Vecchiotti likes it more vertical\nthan usual) from the temporal line. Shave the hair by the proposed\nimplant site.\nDraw a lazy S incision 0.5cm behind the post-auricular crease.\nPlace the NIM and curl the\nleads before you stick the Tegaderm down. Test the monitor. Volume to\nmax, voltage at 0.8.\nPut mastisol where the 1000 drapes will go and put the 1000 drapes\ndown.\nEvaluate the TM with the microscope before you\nprep.\nPrep a wide area. Get the parts of the 1000 drapes that slip behind\neach other. put the craniotomy drape (the one that collects fluid) on\nthe patient. Redraw template. Cut the ear out. Then put the Ioban from\nposterior to anterior pulling the ear forward as you do. Redraw template\nmarkings again. Have scrub drape the microscope and the chairs.\nProcedure\n15 blade for incision, carry down to the temporalis fascia. Raise\nsupraperiosteal flaps anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the EAC.\nCreate a palva flap -- use a bovie (if no contralateral implant\nplaced) down to the bone. Raise the flap with a Lempert periosteal\nelevator to the spine of henle.\nDo a cortical mastoidectomy,\nfocus on the corner where the tegmen and EAC meet. Use a #6 until you\nhit Koerner septum, then switch to a #3 to expose the lateral\nsemicircular canal, incus buttress and the fossa incudes. The incus\npoints to the facial recess. Use the facial nerve stimulator to get an\nidea where the facial nerve is, then take down the air cells on the EAC\n(your gonna take corda) to get through the facial recess. Expose round\nwindow. Drill part of your cochlostomy with a 1 diamond burr\nanterior/inferior to round window until you are about to pop through it\nthen stop.\nUse a freer to create your pocket (make it small/tight. He'll pimp\nyou on what is keeps the implant from moving. The answer is the\ntemporalis tendon blocks the anterior/inferior corner of the implant\nfrom migrating) Put the metal implant template on a Kelly and use that\nto dissect the pocket for a good fit. Use a pen to mark a line from the\nmetal template to the mastoid cavity and use a 3 cutting burr to drill a\nwell for the electrodes. Take some temporalis fascia for later\nIrrigate the mastoid. Ask for blue towels to put around the sterile\narea and change gloves. Open to the cochlear implant. Ask the nurses to\ndisconnect the bovie and the circulator to order the portable x-ray\nUse the #1 diamond burr to finish your cochleostomy. Hold the implant\nfin with AOS forceps and put the implant into the cochleostomy until you\nhit the Silastic stopper. Then advance the electrodes, stop if you feel\nresistance, until the white tabs line up. Pack the cochleostomy\nUse non-compressed gelfoam to pack the mastoid. Close palva flap with\nrunning 4-0 vicryl. Close deep layer with 4-0 vicyrl. Superficial with a\n5-0 fast absorbing plain gut, use dermabond over that. Use a kerlex for\nfluffs. Then do a mastoid dressing (with 2 kerlexs)\nPost-op Instructions\nMastoid/glasscock dressing for 24 hours. Then glasscock dressing at\nnight until follow up\nKeflex until f/u (give a refill on script)\nHOB &gt;30 degrees. Sinus precautions.

Check that it is not lateralized as a lateralized uncinate\n= easy orbital entry\n\n\n\nLook for Haller cells (infraorbital cells) as\nthse crowd middle meatus and can be hard to reach\n\n\n\nLook on floor of maxillary sinus for retention cyst/polyp (if\npresent, may need angled instruments)\n\nFigure 8: (Left) Haller cell (Right) Lateralized uncinate process.\nPalmer and Chiu, Atlas of Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base\nSurgery.\n\nEthmoidectomy/Sphenoidectomy\n(Figure 8)\n\n\n\nSagittal Look at slope of skull base the more it\nslopes, the lower your entry through the basal lamella should be (image\n1 below)\n\n\n\nThe height of the skull base doesn't matter as much as the\ndifference between the height of the roof of maxillary to height\nof skull base matters. Maxillary sinus roof is ur landmark, if\nthe maxillary sinus roof is high, and skull base is low, u may enter\nbasal lamella too high (image 2)\n\n\n\nKeros classification: Distance between fovea ethmoidalis &amp;\ncribriform plate. Type I: 1-3mm; Type 2: 3-7mm; Type 3 (most dangerous)\n7-16mm (Image 2)\n\n\n\nIdentify onodi cells (check coronals) - this is\na posterior ethmoid cell superior or lateral to sphenoid. Important\nbecause the sphenoid isn't posterior to it but the optic nerve/apex is!\n(Image\n\n\n\n\nCheck intrasinus septum of sphenoid (check\naxials) to make sure its doesn't lead to carotid (Image 4)\n\nFrontal Sinusotomy\n\n\n\nCheck sagittal. Determine anterior-posterior dimension of\nfrontal recess. If small, stripping the mucosa in the recess =\nhigh likelihood of restenosis\n\n\n\nCheck for extra cells\n\n\n\nAround bullae: retrobullar, suprabullar, frontal bullar,\n\n\n\nAround orbit: supraorbital ethmoid cell\n\n\n\nAround frontal recess\n\n\n\nAgger nasi\n\n\n\nType 1 (the 1st cell above agger nasi)\n\n\n\nType 2 any cells that are above Type 1 but don't go into frontal\nsinus\n\n\n\nType 3, any cell that extends into frontal sinus\n\n\n\nType 4 within frontal sinus\n\nFigure 9: Palmer and Chiu, Atlas of Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base\nSurgery.\n\nRhinology -- OR Guide\n\nREBEIZ FESS SET\nUP / PROCEDURE\n\n\n\nTELL ANESTHESIA: Ancef or clinda, NOT before cultures are taken.\nETT to the left (no oral rae) no eye protection.\n\n\n\nPATIENT SET-UP: Gel donut head rest. No turning, bring bed south\na bit away from anesthesia, mild reverse tberg. Nothing on the eye (no\nointment, no tegaderm). Make sure headpiece screws are tightened.\u00a0Tuck\narms. Throat pack (vag pack). Pack nasal cavity with afrin. Prep with 5%\nbetadine just on nose. Drape with blue towels: 1 over lip and 1 above\nfusion forehead, no towel clamps, split sheet.\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT/FUSION SET-UP: Tower on opposite side, slave tower on\nsurgeon side. Fusion monitor under surgeon monitor. Set up fusion:\nattach forehead sticker and adjust the sticker on fusion screen to\nmatch. Fusion sensing probe 1 fist away from face. Drape fusion with\nlahey bag. Register fusion first before anything! After registered and\nconfirmed, remove probe and register two fusion suctions (curved and\nstraight). Suction should be connected with silastic tubing. Do not open\nmicrodebrider unless rebeiz wants it. If microdebrider is used, ask\nscrub to set it up first (takes time to calibrate) 0 degree 4mm rigid\nhopkins rod, white balance and focus. Fred on patient's right cheek. Wet\nsponge too.\nSURGERY:\n\n\n\nInject 1%\nlido + epi : root of middle turb and lateral nasal wall. Inject with\npatties in place in middle meatus\n\n\n\nRemove packs, use upbiting forceps to medialize middle\nturb.\n\n\n\nTurbinoplasty with up biting tru-cut\nalong inferomedial, inferior, inferolateral surface of middle turb and\nhold medially for 30 secs\n\n\n\nUncinectomy: Use ostium\nseeker to probe max ostium. With cottle,\nperform uncinectomy, then remove inferior portion with a small\nbackbiter. Use ostium seeker to pull\nthe superior uncinate and remove with a upbiting\ntru-bite. Used curved navigation suction to\nconfirm you've opened it up.\n\n\n\nWiden maxillary antrostomy by excising\nthe posterior fontanelle posterior to the maxillary os with a\nstraight tru-bite\n\n\n\nAnterior ethmoidectomy enter ethmoid\nbullae with suction, remove pieces with blakesley\nforcep\n\n\n\nPosterior ethmoidectomy: identify basal\nlamella (horizontal/vertical portion). Enter basal lamella with a\nj curette on inferior/medial aspect below level of the\nroof of the maxillary sinus\n\nFigure 10: Palmer and Chiu, Atlas of Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base\nSurgery.\n\n\n\nSphenoidotomy: anterior face of sphenoid\n= 7cm from nasal sill. Find it medial to superior turbinate or the\nbolger's box method (the box is superior turbinate [medial], lamina\npapyracea [laterally], skull base, basal lamella: locate it\ninferior/medially). Use a straight tru-bite to transect lower 1/3 of\nsuperior turbinate to better visualize sphenoid os, then use j curette\nto enlarge os laterally\n\n\n\nCome back along skull base using J\ncurette\n\n\n\nFrontal sinusotomy: Enter frontal sinus\nwith ostium seeker then curved suction. Take down the\nsuperior part of the uncinate if that hasn't already been done. If there\nis an agger nasi cell, get a 45 or 70 degree scope and\ntake down inferior part of agger nasi. Do not strip\nmucosa. A lot of people just do balloon dilation for frontal\nsinus\n\n\n\nPack and repeat on other side.\u00a0\nClosing:\n\n\n\nSurgiflo in middle meatus. Suction surgiflo, place kennedy pack\nin middle meatus. Irrigate nasal cavity to inflate pack then place\nbactroban around pack in middle meatus. Suction floor of nose to\nnasopharynx.\n\n\n\nBenzoine along nasal tip. Tie kennedy packs and secure to dorsum\nwith steristrips. Remove throat pack.\nPost-op:\u00a0\n\n\n\nKeflex or clinda (if permanent packing in place)\n\n\n\nf/u a week (Tuesday or Thursday)\n\nSONERU FESS SET\nUP / PROCEDURE\n\n\n\nSoneru typically sends pre-operative antibiotics, steroids, and\nnasal saline rinses (NeilMed Sinus Rinse)\n\n\n\nOnce in the OR, intubate patient and tape the tube to the left\nlower lip.\n\n\n\nTurn 90 Degrees counter-clockwise. Video tower should be at the\nleft side of the patient's head across from where you will stand.\nMedtronic Stealth Navigation tower will be place to the right of the\nvideo tower.\n\n\n\nPlace Afrin soaked pledgets in bilateral nasal cavities.\n\n\n\nMicrodebrider, Medtronic navigation instruments, and FESS trays\nare needed for standard FESS\n\n\n\nHave suction electrocautery and nasopores for hemostasis\nBack to homepage"
