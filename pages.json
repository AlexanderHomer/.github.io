R/O the worst-case scenarios\nNever make assumptions.\nIf you delegate work, you are still responsible for following up on the result\nEscalate any clinical changes in a patient to a senior resident or attending. This is not just to CYA but to avoid mistakes. Two eyes are better than one\nText out to the other residents for any consults, new ED or post-op admissions.\nEveryone\u2019s time is valuable. No matter what level of training you are, no job is above or beneath you. Don\u2019t ask others to do your busy work. No-one is going to clean up your mess.\nHelp the PGY-2. It\u2019s a small service so if anyone isn\u2019t pulling their weight things fall apart. We are our own checks and balances.\nTeach\u2013 you have an obligation to pass on your knowledge to the residents, interns, and medical students under you. If you present, make sure you give people 3-4 take away points.\nBe prepared for every case \u2013 pretend there is no attending with you.\nWhen you present to an attending, give just the meat \u2013 tell them what symptoms the patient has before telling them what the patient doesn\u2019t have**.**\nDon\u2019t miss didactics. The service as a team must protect this time.\nTemporal bones don\u2019t drill themselves \u2013 but they want to be drilled. Keep the temporal bone lab in good working order and harvest bones in the Spring\nTreat every day like a job interview \u2013 The attendings notice when you work hard and when you slack off. Ultimately, their opinion of you dictates your ability to get a job/match into a fellowship after residency.\nUpdate the guide: every time you think \u201cthis would be useful for the pocketbook,\u201d add it in. This doesn\u2019t update itself.\nTry and improve every aspect of our program. Everyone has to do their bit to leave this program better off than when you came.\nDaily Routine\nThings to Do Before Rounds\n\n\nSend Staff E-mail (performed by on-call resident)\n\n\nOvernight Consults / Calls / Admissions / Discharges requiring follow-up\n\n\nSign-In Pagers on Residents In-House \u2013 \u201cIn Hospital \u2013 On Page\u201d\n\n\n3552 \u2013 Chief\n\n1699\u2013 Senior(s)\n1221/5511 \u2013 Mid Level(s)\n1777 \u2013 Junior\n\\\n      #### - Intern\n\nUpdate List &amp; Print for Everyone\n\n\nOn-Call (Resident, Adult Attending, &amp; Pedi Attending)\n\nRoom Numbers (Walk rounds order: North ascending, Floating &amp; Main building descending)\nVitals / I&amp;Os (including drain outputs)\n\n\n-The last 3 JP outputs (q8hrs) should be written from oldest to newest (e.g. 25\u219215\u21925)\n\n\nLabs / Imaging / Cultures / Path\n\nThings to Do After Rounds\n\n\nUpdate List\n\n\nOn-Call (Resident, Adult Attending, &amp; Pedi Attending)\n\nRoom Numbers (Walk rounds order: North ascending, Main building descending)\nDaily Hospital Course\nMeds / Diet / Lines / Drains\nLabs / Imaging / Cultures\nTo Do List\nDischarge Paperwork / Scripts\nUpdate Pathology / Trauma\n\nSign-out Pagers\n\n\n1777 = \u201cOut of Hospital \u2013 On Page\u201d\n\n1777 = Covered by on call resident\nOn-call resident = \u201cOut of Hospital \u2013 On Page\u201d\n4100 (Chief) = \u201cRedirect to Chief\u2019s cell phone\u201d\nAll other pagers = \u201cOut of hospital \u2013 Not Available\u201d\n\nWeekly Routines\nMonday: PGY-2 sends out final radiology rounds list\nTuesday:\nAttending on-call switches\nPGY-4 reminds on-call attending re mock orals the next day)\nWednesday (didactic day)\n7-7:30am: Mock Orals (On-call attending vs PGY-4)\n7:30-8am: Chalk talk: Med students, PGY-1, PGY-2s, rotating interns\n8-9am: Radiology conference\n12:15-1pm: Audiology Lecture (students, PGY-1, PGY-2)\n1-2pm: Tumor Board: run by PGY-4 or PGY-5\n2:30-3:30pm: Resident Review session (Boardvital questions etc.)\n4-6pm: Didactics\nThursday (8:30am OR start): 7:00-8am: Article review (led by PGY-4/PGY-5)\nFriday:\nPGY-5 e-mails out weekly schedule.\nSaturday: nothing\nSunday: PGY-2 sends out prelim radiology rounds list\nMonthly Routines\nTrauma Conference: first Thursday of the month every other month (odd numbered months).

If sounds like a large active bleed, they go to the nearest ED, otherwise they come to us.\nFever: Fever is expected for up to 2 weeks. If fever continues, can consider course of azithromycin (sometimes adenoid bed can become infected)\nNeck Pain: A small amount of neck pain is expected (typically from suspension or the adenoidectomy). If the patient cannot move their neck, send patient to ED for CT to r/o Grisel\u2019s syndrome (especially if patient has down syndrome)\nPain: check if patient has been able to receive pain meds (often parents can\u2019t get kids to drink the meds). Offer PR Tylenol to help catch up pain\n\n\nPost Septorhinoplasty Q&amp;A\n\nDuration of swelling/bruising: 7-10days. Ways to reduce: sit up, apply ice\nWhen can I blow nose: gentile blowing starts 1-week post-op\nWhen should nasal drainage stop? 2-3 days postop\nWhen can I resume sports: light exercise 2-3 weeks. Sports where nose could be injured (ball-sports/contact sports) 3 months.\nWhen does nasal fullness/congestion subside \u2013 few weeks to a month\nWhen can I return to work \u2013 probably 1 week. Sooner if they are up to it but need to take it easy w/ lifting and moving\nCan I use my CPAP post-op \u2013 No (especially if cosmetic or osteotomies are performed since mask sits on nose + packing is in nose). May be able to start after packing removed at 1-week post-op check (Dr. Lee is typically okay once packing comes out). Tell patients to sit up or discuss with sleep specialist\nWhen can I wear sunglasses: Can wear them over splint. Once splint comes off, if possible, try and avoid glasses on bridge of nose for another 1 week (especially if osteotomies done) but can wear them if needed \u2013 just try and take them off for small periods of time.\nWhen can I fly? 2-3 weeks post-op\n\nPost-ear surgery Restrictions:\n\nGlasscock dressing: 1-2 days\nFor Dr. Sillman: Glasscock/cotton bud in ear is removed after 2 days, then ear drops started\nSinus precautions: 2 weeks\nRestrictions on flying: 2-3 weeks\nRestriction on scuba diving: for stapedectomy - forever\nDry ear precautions: 6 weeks\n\nSinus Surgery Restrictions:\n\nSinus precautions for 2-3 weeks\nAvoid flying for 2-3 weeks\n\nTravel Restrictions:\n\n\nAvoid flying for:\n\n\nSinus surgery or septorhinoplasty \u2014 2-3 weeks\n\nEar surgery (except tubes) \u2014 2-3 weeks\nStapedectomy \u2014 2 weeks for Dr. Sillman (6-8 weeks: most other Otologists)\n\nAvoid travelling far from hospital\n\n\nTonsillectomies: 2 weeks\n\n\nPost-Op Precautions:\n\n\nDry ear precautions:\n\n\nBefore showering, coat a small piece of cotton with a tablespoon of Vaseline ointment. Gently insert the cotton ball into the ear canal and keep in for the duration of the shower.\n\nIf swimming or bathing is desired, purchase earplugs and a headband to keep earplugs from falling out.\n\nSinus Precautions:\n\n\nBlowing your nose: Do not pinch your nose: do not blow your nose. You can gently wipe your nose if needed.\n\nSneezing: If you must sneeze, keep your mouth open and do not pinch your nose closed.\nSucking in air/liquid: Do not drink though a straw. Do not smoke.\nBlowing out air: Do not play a wind instrument. Do not blow up balloons.\nPushing or lifting: Do not lift or push objects weighing more than 20 pounds. Avoid strenuous activity. Please use soft softeners.\nBending over: Keep your head above the level of your heart. Sleep with your head slightly raised\n\nConsults\nEpistaxis\n\nMost bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.\nCheck for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry environment, cocaine use. Check the BP, coags, platelets. Find out which side the bleed started\nBring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope, phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel, Surgifoam, Bactroban, ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 &amp; #9 Frazier tip suction, silver nitrate cautery. Can bring thrombigel or ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you want to get fancy\n\nThink posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the maxillary sinus) For posterior bleeds, can use:\n\n\n10F Foley \u2013 Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/ 10cc, pull until balloon wedges against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal alar. Monitor for palate necrosis\n\nEpistat \u2013 put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with 7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw until balloon wedges against posterior nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.\nAnt/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) \u2013 works well. Inflate until the patient can\u2019t tolerate it anymore\nRule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires hospital admission and pulse ox monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia you are monitoring for)\nIt\u2019s never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both sides, take at least one of them out.\n\n\n\n\nED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is coming from and why it is happening. Find the bleeding source\nSoak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming from.\nIf its anterior and a vessel can be seen, use a silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop down onto patients\u2019 lips and discolor their skin.\nIf its further back (mid septum), wrap surgicel around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and press it against the area that\u2019s bleeding.\nIf it\u2019s posterior: use a posterior pack. Pumping vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.\nIf it\u2019s an HHT patient. Surgiflo seems to work best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with it.\n\n\nPTAs\n\nCBC w/ Diff; Rapid Strep; Monospot\nDecadron 10 mg IV x 1 (only if drained or neg needle aspiration + neg CT for abscess;\nUnasyn IV or Clindamycin (PCN allergic) x1 only if CBC shows no atypical lymphocytes &amp; monospot is negative; then continue PO x 7-14 days\nTo Drain: yankeur suction at bedside, 18-gauge needle, &gt;27-gauge needle, 10 mL syringe, 5 mL syringe, lidocaine with epi, tongue depressor, 15 blade, Kelly clamp, hurricane spray\nHurricane spray -&gt; lido w/ epi -&gt; You can needle aspirate to localize the region. March down the side of the peritonsillar space, it can be lower than you think. When you strike gold, send it for culture, then do an I&amp;D w/ a #15 blade and spread with clamp.\nLow threshold to scope (unless you have a CT) to clear the airway as edema can track down\n\n\nTracheostomy\n\nFamily discussion completed by primary team (you aren\u2019t responsible for that talk)\n\nCoagulation\n\n\nPlatelet, H/H, INR/PTT\n\nAnticoagulation (why? Can it be shut off) \u2013 lovenox stop 24hrs before, heparin gtt 4-5 hours before - see anticoagulation guide\nIntubation hx (PEEP (PEEP &gt;8 makes trachs much more difficult \u2013 pts quickly desat, trach has higher risk of dislodging) duration, traumatic? Tube size? Extubation attempts, exposure)\nOperative Steps: Place shoulder roll. mark out midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep &amp; drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don\u2019t open to wide (you\u2019ll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3rd tracheal rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff, put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by making two horizontal incisions over 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to withdraw circuit until it\u2019s just above window then, if you have time, place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return, secure trach w/ 4-point sutures &amp; Velcro trach tie.\n\n\nAngioedema\n\nLook for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema. Always scope to r/o airway edema.\nLabs: get complement protein C4 levels and C1-INH (low levels -&gt; suspect C1 esterase deficiency). Also get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP, ESR\nCauses: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs\n\nTime frame:\n\n\nHistamine related - comes &amp; goes within 12 hours\n\nLisinopril related \u2013 can take 2 days for swelling to decrease\nHereditary angioedema \u2013 can take DAYS\nRec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.\n\nIf hereditary angioedema, can consider:\n\n\nPurified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest).\n\nEcallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)\nIcatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist\nIf significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise admit to MICU overnight for airway monitoring and rescope in morning\nHave a game plan for intubation \u2013 speak to Anesthesia to notify that patient is being admitted, provide plan for intubation, nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.\n\nParotitis/Sialadenitis\n\nMASH: Massage, antibiotics, sialagogues (lemon drops, orange wedges), hydration/heat.\n\nEar Foreign Body\n\nAlways ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with tuning fork exam\nAsk the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan) is rarely enough\nGet a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it behind the foreign body and pop it out\nIf the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid putting in drops as this could cause the foreign body to swell\n\nFish Bone\n\nDo a fiberoptic exam. If you can\u2019t see it, offer a thin-cut CT w/o contrast through the larynx\nIf fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4% lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb the posterior oropharynx\nUse the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill forceps\nHave a nurse wrap patient\u2019s tongue with gauze and pull it out to improve access.\nFor children, its often easier to go to the OR.\n\n\nOrbital Cellulitis\n\n\nPreseptal vs Orbital Cellulitis:\n\n\nOrbital cellulitis is likely to have chemosis, pain with EOMI, restricted eye movement\n\nWhen to drain a subperiosteal abscess? If the abscess volume is &lt;1250mm3 can avoid OR (measure abscess in 3 dimensions WxDxL in mm)\n\nHow to tell if there is a cavernous sinus thrombosis: get a MRI with contrast.\n\n\nLook at DTI/DWI (isoDTI) - if the Cavernous sinus lights up, strong indication for Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Look for edema. If in the vessels, think of thrombophlebitis.\n\nRule out shine through. ADC map (dDTI) should be the opposite of the DWI (isoDTI) if it\u2019s true. If they are the same, this is shine through effect.\n\nOn T1 post contrast- look for filling defect. Then confirm on DWI\n\n\n1-2mm should be size of superior ophthalmic vein. Expect it to be dilated on both sides\n\n\n\n\n\nAirway patients with stridor\n\nAsk: onset of stridor + speed of progression. Eval for infectious vs inflammatory vs foreign body vs neoplastic\nEvaluate: O2 sat, respiratory rate, retractions, ability to lay supine. Stridor: insp: supraglottic/glottic. Biphasic: glottic/subglottic. Expiratory: trachea/bronchi. Perform fiberoptic exam and check airway\n\nManagement**:**\n\n\nAirway widely patent and mild edema, slow progression of symptoms \u2192 observation on floor w/ O2 monitoring\n\nAirway patent but moderate edema (e.g. angioedema patients) \u2192 observation in ICU\nUnable to entire airway \u2192 OR for awake fiberoptic intubation w/ possible awake trach\nUnable to see any airway \u2192 OR for awake trach\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgical Airway patients\n\nAlert an attending\nNasal trumpet, Heliox if increased WOB\nBag Mask (may not be the best) or LMA\nIf stable, perform fiberoptic exam. If intubation needed, try and do in OR\n\n\n\nPediatric Stridor\n\nScope with nursing and bag mask equipment available. Always ask the NICU RN before you even touch a kid in the NICU\nWhen you scope, scope around the nasal cannula, don\u2019t remove it\nNo reflux medications in NICU babies unless the attending clears it (causes NEC)\n\nDDX:\n\n\nLaryngomalacia\n\nVF immobility: see VF immobility workup in Pedi ENT section\n\nComplete tracheal rings\n\nGet echo, head u/s +/- MRI\nMBS if VF immobility\nLow threshold for DLB\n\n\n\nTransfers\n\nNever accept an unstable transfer.\nNo direct admits unless one of our attendings has accepted it. In general, transfers go through the ED\n\nAdmissions from ED \u2013 What service?\nIn general, we have adopted the same model as Orthopedics.\n\nAdmit to Medicine with ENT consult: Adults with non-surgical issue (peritonsillar phlegmon, angioedema) or surgical issue + multiple co-morbidities (taking medications for T2DM and HTN) or is high risk (history of MI)\nAdmit to ENT: Adults with non-complicated surgical patients (e.g.: retropharyngeal abscess) and those with post-op complications (unless it is purely medical e.g. poor PO intake, pain control etc.).\nAdmit to Pediatrics: Typically, all pediatric patients except those with post-surgical complications go to Pediatrics\n\n\nGeneral rule: Be reasonable. Medicine are reasonable\u2026which means they tend to get dumped on a lot. We should take the simple patients onto our service. At the same time, recognize that we are in the ORs during the day and are home-call at night so don\u2019t have the manpower to manage difficult patients.\nInpatient or bedded outpatient patients who had surgery: they come to our service.\n\nFacial Trauma Guide\nGuidelines\n1. Not all traumas need to be seen by ENT service when resident is not in house\n2. On call resident must be called for all fractures as per previous ED practice\n3. All imaging must be reviewed by on call resident at time of call\n4. As outlined below, Category 1 patients do not need to be seen, unless deemed necessary by Resident after reviewing imaging. On call Resident will see every patient in Category 2.\n5. ALL pediatric facial trauma should be seen in ED, regardless of category (Pediatric Trauma service should be consulted as well)\n6. All trauma consults that come in from 7 am to 5 pm will be seen, regardless of Category.\n7. All fractures, even if Category 1, will be seen in ED if they have lacerations that require ENT repair\n8. Any patient transferred to Tufts from OSH for ENT/Facial trauma evaluation must be seen ED\n9. Any patient with specific concern raised by ED attending will be seen in ED\n10. All outpatients/discharges should have followed up scheduled within 1 week of trauma as outlined below \u2013 Resident will coordinate this and provide information to the ED\nTiming of Trauma Follow up\n| Timing of Trauma | Follow up |\n|----|----|\n| Mon-Wed | By end of week |\n| Thur | Friday or beginning of following week |\n| Fri-Sun | Beginning of following week |\n*Exception is operative nasal bone fractures, which should be seen earlier so that they may be seen in clinic and taken to OR in appropriate time.\n\n-Adult \u2013 arrange clinic follow up in 2-3 days, plan for OR in 7-10 days\n-Pediatric \u2013 clinic follow up ASAP, plan for OR in 4-6 days\n\nCategory 1: Facial fractures that do not require evaluation in the ED\n1.

All LeFort fractures\n5. All frontal sinus fractures\nCategory 3: Temporal bone fractures\n*Resident must be called, imaging must be reviewed\n*Isolated squamous temporal bone fractures, or any temporal bone with no involvement of otic capsule, facial nerve, middle ear, or subjective hearing loss, does not require ENT consultation. Patient should be seen in follow up in 2 weeks.\n*If involves carotid canal, consider CTA\n*Bloody otorrhea should be managed with drops (Floxin or equivalent, 5 gtt BID) but does not require evaluation. Must set up outpatient follow up 1 week.\n*If patient is being admitted, must be seen by ENT in house within 24 hours\n*tuning fork on all awake patients\nTrauma Red Flags\n\nPenetrating Trauma: Levels of Neck- explore level II.\nEnophthalmos, Proptosis, EOM, PERRL, Pain on motion, diplopia\nClear otorrhea, hemotympanum, perforation, abnormal tuning fork,\nClear rhinorrhea, Perforated septum, septal hematoma,\nTrismus, Malocclusion, Teeth fractured,\nC-spine tenderness\nAbnormal Cranial Nerve exam\n\nMandible Fractures and their management\n\nIn general: Locking plates: preferred because they are less likely to bring segments of bone towards the plate when screwing\nMandible Fracture Plates\nload sharing (lag-screw plates, compression plates, miniplates)\nload bearing (big recon bars - needed for comminuted fractures and atrophic edentulous patients\nMandible Fracture repair by site:\n\nSymphysis and parasymphysis: require two plates or one recon bar, MMF = 24G.

Note: Dr. Sillman says every tinnitus patient should get an audiogram as they often have high-tone SNHL (if hearing loss, can recommend hearing aids)\n-In general, don\u2019t get imaging. Only get imaging if tinnitus + either unilateral/asymmetric hearing loss or neurological abnormalities\n-Tx: can observe for bothersome tinnitus that has lasted for &lt;6months. For tinnitus that is bothersome &amp; persistent (&gt;6months) guideline recommends: sound therapy (white noise machine), cognitive behavior therapy, and hearing aids (ONLY IF patients have hearing loss).

Incision shouldn\u2019t be so superior that it is visible from the frontal view. It should extend inferiorly enough to access the entire conchal bowel. Use a 15 blade to incise down to the cartilage. Use Kay scissors (not curved iris scissors to exposure the cartilage all the way up to the antihelix. Develop it posteriorly as well. Use a 30G needle around the edge of the conchal bowl to demonstrate where the extent of your dissection should be and mark it with a marking pen. Use a 15 blade to release the cartilage in a C shaped incision. Make the incision as wide and big as possible. Dissect the reverse side of the cartilage with a pair of converse scissors. Use 5-0 vicyrl to reapproximate the deep layer and 5-0 fast absorbing plain gut for superficial. Use the 5-0 fast absorbing plain gut for thru-and-thru basting sutures to prevent a hematoma and put a bactroban soaked cotton ball in conchal bowl. Cotton comes out in 24hrs.\nLee- Sentinel lymph node biopsy\nYOU NEED: NeoProbe (to find where the LN are), 30 gauge needle (short needle is OK), methylene blue (at least 1mL), and NIM monitor\nThe patient will have gone to radiology and had a lymphoscintography prior to coming to the pre-operative area. Likely, radiology will have put an \u201cX\u201d or two over the area(s) that have lit up on their scan. They will also provide a paper print out of the areas that \u201clit up;\u201d this should be in an envelope attached to the patient chart in pre-op. Based on where those \u201cX\u201ds are (and thus where the sentinel lymph nodes are most likely to be), you and Dr. Lee will decide what proper nerve monitoring will need to occur (ie: facial nerve monitoring for an intra-parotid LN vs. marginal mandibular for a neck LN, for example).\nOften the sentinel lymph node biopsy will be part of a larger procedure, but these are the main steps for the SLNB:\n\nUse the NeoProbe to locate the lymph nodes that activate the highest; usually near the pre-marked Xs. The proper LN should register in/around 180-200, with all the surrounding areas registering in at significantly lower values (ie: 40-50).\nWith this info, decide on the proper nerve monitoring, and set up the NIM.\nGo to the primary lesion. Inject methylene blue with the 30 gauge needle circumferentially. This MUST be in the dermal plane, as that\u2019s where the lymphatics are. You should see the methylene blue splay underneath the skin.\nInject, prep, drape. This is generally not a full neck dissection. This will usually be a 2-3cm incision, dissect to find the LN using the NeoProbe to check on location, and find the LN.\nFind the LN. Note, this may NOT appear like a pathologic LN. This may be a subcentimeter LN that has some slight hypervascularity/blue tint.\nTest the LN on the back table. If you have the right LN, the NeoProbe should register at the same level as before. Test the bed in which the LN came from. The surrounding areas should not register more than 20% of the original high-registering value (some people say 10% of highest value). If it does, there are more LN to get.\nClose.\n\nLee- Skin Grafting\nPrep out the thigh (usually right thigh) using Chlorhexidine. Try to find an area of the thigh that is most flat and without skin lesions. Drape using an upside down half sheet. Place a folded blue towel with a clamp on it over the prepped thigh. This ultimately gets covered with the over-drape, but the blue towel and clamp makes it easy to find when you\u2019re ready to take the skin graft.\nWhen it\u2019s time, feel the clamp, cut out the area with scissors. Staple the edges of the over-drape down.\nMeasure out the skin graft (extra 1-2 cm in both directions). Rub mineral oil over the thigh. We use mineral oil because (1) it will not become rancid and (2) it smooths the area for easy skin graft harvesting.\nPreparing the skin graft blade: for STSG, Dr. Lee likes to set it somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3 inches. You should be able to fit a flat 15-blade between the blade and the machine; this will give you a good split thickness skin graft width if you can\u2019t remember 0.2-0.3 or if you\u2019re using a different machine.\nChoose the width gauge that is roughly 1-2cm larger than what you need.\nPlace the skin graft machine on the thigh at an angle dictated by the side piece (there is a slight angle to the width gauge; roughly 20-30 degrees). Press relatively firmly and push forward. Use DeBakey\u2019s to grasp the skin graft.\nAgain, cut the graft so it is roughly 1-2cm longer than what you think you need. You do NOT need to mesh the graft. You will cut a few drainage holes in it once the graft is attached. You will likely bolster it down with cotton dipped in mineral oil wrapped in Xeroform, held down by silk ties. The skin graft site will be covered by a large Allevyn dressing, which stays there for one week.\n\nLee-Post Mohs Reconstruction\nFlap Types\n\n\nPivotal\n\n\nRotation: eg cervicofacial advancement, O-to-Z\n\nTranspositional: eg bilobed and rhombic\nInterpolation: base of flap bridges over tissue: eg paramedian\nIsland: eg V-toY island flap\n\nAdvancement\n\n\nUnipedicle.

Surgical excision is typically better since anti-TB drugs need to be taken for 3-12months\n\n\n\nInflammatory:\n\n\nKawasaki: fever x 5days + four of the following:\nCervical LAD (2) Desquamation of hands/feet (3) Exanthum (rash) (4) Conjunctivitis (5) Lip/OC erythema (Strawberry tongue)\nRosai-Dorfman. Looks like mono. Plasma cells and histiocytes in biopsy\nDrug-induced: Phenytoin (also pyrimethamine, allopurinol, phenylbutazone)\nSarcoidosis: Get ACE levels\n\nPEDIATRIC VASCULAR LESIONS\n\nIn general: They grow at the same rate as the child, do not involute\n\nInfantile Hemangiomas:\n\nCan be present at birth but typically noted after birth (unlike vascular malformations). Enlarge w/ crying/straining. Associated w/ GLUT-1\nPhases\nProliferation: Enlarge to about 80% final size by 12months (rarely grows after 12months)\nInvolution: 50% regress by 5 years, 70% by 7years\nDiagnosis: MRI - high intensity T2, flow voids\n\nIf in beard distribution CNV: think PHACES (posterior fossa, hemangiomas, aorta/cardiac, seye, sternal pits) more common in females\n\nGet cardiac u/s &amp; Head MRI to r/o posterior cranial fossa abnormalities. Possible risk of subglottic hemangiomas (do DLB if any respiratory symptoms)\nTreatment: Propanolol: during proliferative phase (aka under 1yo)\nMake sure no cardiac issues and &gt;5weeks old: consider in-hospital if high risk (concurrent diagnoses, airway symptoms), monitor glucose.\nDose: Start 0.5mg/kg/day (divided into 2-3x/day dosing). Give 1st dose in office. Monitor vitals for 2 hours and check blood sugar. Advance dose by 0.5mg/kk/dose q4days to 2 mg/kg/day as tolerated (many ppl have patients come back when increasing dose to monitor for another 2 hours). Stop after 12 month old (taper over 4 weeks). Stop if patient has illness (n/v) or wheezing from a cold. Once illness has resolved, can resume treatment\nSuperficial: can be treated with Pulse dye laser (PDL)\nSubglottic: Treat with CO2 laser resection\n\n\n\nCongenital Hemangiomas\n\nNot associated with GLUT-1. Typically fully formed at birth. Types:\nRapidly Involuting (RICH): disappear by 18month of age\nNon-involving (NICH): consider embolization and excision once child is school age\n\nKasabach-merrit dx:\n\nUnlike infantile hemangiomas - they do not spontaneously involute\nCause coagulopathy, bleeding risk\n\nLOW FLOW VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS\n\nCapillary Malformations: Presents with Port-Wine stain at birth. Associated with Sturge Weber syndrome: Can involve leptomeninges- risk of seizures, mental retardation. Treatment: Pulse Dye Laser\nVenous malformations: Commonly on the lips. Bluish hue. Can cause consumption coagulopathy. Imaging shows calcifications (phleboliths) because of low flow. Tx Sclerotherapy\nLymphatic Malformations\n\n\nMacrocystic &gt;2cm2. Microcystic &lt;2cm2\n\nStaging: suprahyoid worse than infrahyoid and bilateral is worse than unilateral\n\n\nLateral to lateral canthus\u2014tend to be macrocytic. Medial = microcystic.\n\nSymptoms/Presentation: airway compression (often needs an EXIT procedure if detected in utereo). Painful if infected. Hemorrhage into cyst can cause rapid enlargement\n\nTreatment:\n\n\nSclerotherapy: 100% ethanol, OK-432, doxycycline, bleomycin, Sirolimus\n\nIf suprahyoid, may involve oral/mucosa look for airway swelling w/ therapy\nBest for Macrocystic stage I diseases (microcystic/bilateral is more resistant)\n\n\nMacrocystic posterior neck, infrahyoid, LMs without septations can be observed\nExcision if symptomatic (low recurrence if completely removed but should be conservative)\n\nHIGH FLOW \u2014 ARTERIAL/ARTERIOVENOUS\n\nSmall in childhood then rapid growth with puberty.\nPatients have a bruit. Untreated, can have heart failure\nWorkup: Doppler, CTA. Tx: preop embolization and then resection\n\nMALIGNANT LESIONS\n\nLipomas: mobile\nNeurofibromas: Think family history of NF1 (Chr 17).

Have bipolar set on 10/10.\nCLOSING \u2013 in general:\n\n4.0 vicryl for deep layers; buried interrupted\n5.0 or 6.0 fast absorbing gut for skin; simple running\n5.0 monocryl if closing skin with subcuticular stitches\nProlene if placing drain\nBacitracin ointment (occasionally dermabond)\n\nSistrunk (Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Excision) Technique: see article Posterior Hyoid Space as Related to Excision of the Thyroglossal Duct Cyst John Maddalozzo, MD, FAAP, FACS, Jeremy Alderfer, MD; Vikash Modi, MD The Laryngoscope 2010\nCochlear Implants (Vecchiotti)\nTo confirm before patient enters room\n\nCheck the patient\u2019s ear in the pre-op area to r/o mucoid effusion.\nMake sure CPD have pulled the cochlear implant instruments kit (there is a special kit for each CI manufacturer), the ear kit, an M&amp;T kit, the Paparella press (for tympmastoids) the Visao drill with a 6 cutting, 3 cutting, 2 coarse diamond and 1 fine diamond drill on the field (a 1.5 fine diamond off the field as well)\nMake sure they have the PURPLE permanent marker on the field (it\u2019s the only one that draws on the Ioban)\nMake sure they have a NIM nerve stimulator (the one where you can change the voltage) on the field\nA big bag of saline and big bag of sterile water handing on the irrigation machine (the one used for the microdebrider). Don\u2019t allow the scrubs to open an actual microdebrider\u2026for their sake.\nMake sure the cochlear instruments have these templates (Cochlear Corp)\nBalance the microscope. Don\u2019t drape it yet.\nCall audiology and give them the serial numbers for the cochlear implants\nThings to put on the non-sterile side table:\nM&amp;T kit, mastisol, 1000 drapes cut in half (need 5-6), NIM electrodes, tegederms cut in \u00bd, a razor, alcohol prep pads, lidocaine)\n\n\nSet up\n\n\nBed rotated 180 degrees. Leica microscope at head of bed, tower can be on the scrub side of microscope, NIM monitor and suction on the scrub side by the feet.\nDraw out the BTE template. Draw out the location of the implant using the silicone template. This has to be above the temporal line and make the angle that it sits &gt;45 degrees (Vecchiotti likes it more vertical than usual) from the temporal line. Shave the hair by the proposed implant site.\nDraw a lazy S incision 0.5cm behind the post-auricular crease.\nPlace the NIM and curl the leads before you stick the Tegaderm down. Test the monitor. Volume to max, voltage at 0.8.\nPut mastisol where the 1000 drapes will go and put the 1000 drapes down.\nEvaluate the TM with the microscope before you prep.\nPrep a wide area. Get the parts of the 1000 drapes that slip behind each other. put the craniotomy drape (the one that collects fluid) on the patient. Redraw template. Cut the ear out. Then put the Ioban from posterior to anterior pulling the ear forward as you do. Redraw template markings again. Have scrub drape the microscope and the chairs.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n15 blade for incision, carry down to the temporalis fascia. Raise supraperiosteal flaps anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the EAC.\nCreate a palva flap \u2013 use a bovie (if no contralateral implant placed) down to the bone. Raise the flap with a Lempert periosteal elevator to the spine of henle.\nDo a cortical mastoidectomy, focus on the corner where the tegmen and EAC meet. Use a #6 until you hit Koerner septum, then switch to a #3 to expose the lateral semicircular canal, incus buttress and the fossa incudes. The incus points to the facial recess. Use the facial nerve stimulator to get an idea where the facial nerve is, then take down the air cells on the EAC (your gonna take corda) to get through the facial recess. Expose round window. Drill part of your cochlostomy with a 1 diamond burr anterior/inferior to round window until you are about to pop through it then stop.\nUse a freer to create your pocket (make it small/tight. He\u2019ll pimp you on what is keeps the implant from moving. The answer is the temporalis tendon blocks the anterior/inferior corner of the implant from migrating) Put the metal implant template on a Kelly and use that to dissect the pocket for a good fit. Use a pen to mark a line from the metal template to the mastoid cavity and use a 3 cutting burr to drill a well for the electrodes. Take some temporalis fascia for later\nIrrigate the mastoid. Ask for blue towels to put around the sterile area and change gloves. Open to the cochlear implant. Ask the nurses to disconnect the bovie and the circulator to order the portable x-ray\nUse the #1 diamond burr to finish your cochleostomy. Hold the implant fin with AOS forceps and put the implant into the cochleostomy until you hit the Silastic stopper. Then advance the electrodes, stop if you feel resistance, until the white tabs line up. Pack the cochleostomy\nUse non-compressed gelfoam to pack the mastoid. Close palva flap with running 4-0 vicryl. Close deep layer with 4-0 vicyrl. Superficial with a 5-0 fast absorbing plain gut, use dermabond over that. Use a kerlex for fluffs. Then do a mastoid dressing (with 2 kerlexs)\n\n\nPost-op Instructions\n\n\nMastoid/glasscock dressing for 24 hours.

(The correct way to irrigate the nasal cavity is to place the bulb suction in the nostril, squeeze, and gradually remove will still squeezing so irrigation gets on the patient\u2019s face. Do not release the squeeze while in the nose, as this could cause epistaxis and general annoyance.)\nSuction stomach with adult orogastric tube \u201cTummy time\u201d\nRemove everything, you\u2019re done!\n\nNasal endoscopy case/DCR in combo w/ ophtho - Scott\n- Afrin-soaked pledgets\n- 4.0 zero degree scope (this can be obtained from airway cart, does not need to be sterile, ie. don\u2019t need pedi FESS kit solely for the scope)\n- lido w/\u00a0epi with yellow tip 27gauge needle\n- 4.0 Vicryl TF (if suturing stent in place)\n- BMT kit usually\u00a0adequate for equipment (alligator, Frazier tip suctions), also might need freer - unless planning for full DCR in which case FESS kit +/- drill (not sure which kind) may be necessary\nButterfly tympanoplasty \u2013 Scott\nSteps:\n-inject canal. Make an incision on posterior tragus. Incise through the cartilage to anterior surface. Elevate anterior surface first. Then do posterior. Keep scissors bevel up (check what this means). KEEP the perichondrium on the cartilage\n-just close incision with 2 interrupted sutures to prevent a tragal hematoma\n-rim perforation. Then use cartilage, size it 2mm larger than perforation. Butterfly the cartilage with a #15 blade (circumferentially score it). The perichondrium will cause the edges to curl so it looks like a ear tube.

Arm needs to rest on arm board, place sterile drape on arm board.\nPlace a towel around the armpit and use Edna to clip it. Then, wrap a sponge around the thumb to supinate the forearm and clip the sponge to the arm board with an Edna.\nThen cover the arm with towel to keep sterile.\nDr. Tracy will then wrap the arm with an elastic wrap to drain it off its venous supply. Then the tourniquet will be applied as a setting of 250 and a timer for 1 hour starts.\nBegin by incising the lateral aspect of the skin paddle to find the Cephalic vein which is preserved and follow it all the way up to the antecubital fossa. Next use forceps to find the vascular pedicle then you can raise the flap on the contralateral side and isolate and tie off the vascular pedicle and start lifting the flap\nDr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s Thyroidectomy\nPrep:\nLaryngeal nerve monitoring tube is needed and the Medtronic NIM monitor. No paralytics, and needs antibiotics. Watch anesthesia\u2019s glidescope to ensure that the blue stripe is adjacent to the vocal cords. Place the gel ax roll as the shoulder roll and recheck the tube placement with the glidescope. Attach the nerve monitor consul at the head of the bed and tape it in place. Ensure that the nerve monitor is working appropriately by tapping in the neck. Mark the neck along a nerve crease if possible 2-3 cm above the sternal notch. Inject with 1% lidocaine with epi. Prep with betadine.\nDr. Dhingra\u2019s Thyroidectomy\nInject incision in preop.\nMake generous incision 2 inches above the sternum then make the incision down past the platysma on both sides and use the Bovie to develop yourself sub-platysmal flaps. Use your finger as a come hither motion to get them going and work a free edge. Go down to the sternum on the inferior flap. Go up to the cricoid/thyroid notch superiorly.\nThen travel down midline kind of like you would do with a trach. Use kelly\u2019s to present the midline fascia for someone to divide with the bovie.\nKeep going making sure you\u2019re a midline until you come down to the thyroid. Be careful inferiorly because there is a plexus of vessels and become very vascular. Here use the ligasure to make sure you don\u2019t make anything bleed.\nOnce you found the thyroid then you want to work the sternothyroid off the thyroid to develop the lateral edge of the thyroid. To do this, get two peanuts: one using to retract the thyroid towards you and the other to push on the undersurface of the sternothyroid to elevate it off. Once you have enough of an edge, ask for the lady finger for someone to retract. Once you\u2019ve developed the lateral edge, keep doing it up towards the superior pole. Here there are a lot of vessels so be sure to use the Ligasure.\nThis is the part to pay attention to: developing the superior pole is the one of three or four critical steps. You should not look for the superior laryngeal nerve necessarily but you should be cognizant of the cricothyroid muscle.\nOnce you have freed the superior pole you can develop the middle a little bit more but don\u2019t get too deep/posterior. This is when you have to check to see where your current laryngeal nerve is remember the different landmarks.\n\nLocated in simon's triangle: trachea, carotid, and inferior lobe.\nRLN is deep to berry's ligament\nTubercle of Zuckerkandl: RLN is medial to it. Superior thyroid is superior to it\nLeft RLN is more medial than right RLN. Left RLN is reliably deep to inferior thyroid a\nSuperior Parathyroid is posterior to RLN. Inferior parathyroid is anterior to RLN\n\nIn reality you\u2019re going to use a snit forcep spreading in the direction of the nerve and using the stimulator. Once you found it follow superiorly and inferiorly see that you are confident of the plane typically people follow it all the way into its insertion.\nOnce you\u2019ve done that you can free the rest of the middle and inferior pole of the thyroid and of the trachea. You can do this relatively quickly as the nerve is protected. Once the thyroid only attached to the trachea, use a Kelly and spread along the trachea in the midline superior to inferior (you can use a bovie to take it off the trachea as well as the plane is pretty well developed). Then you can transect half of it and do the otherside. Dump some thrombin soaked Gelfoam into the resected area close the straps with 3-0 Vicryl. Close the platysma with 4-0 Vicryl and close the wound with a subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl.\nDr Wein Thyroidectomy\nSimilar set up to Dhingra\u2019s. When you lift the upper subplatysmal flap, roll skin over a wet 4x8 gauze and suture to mandible with 2-0 silk to retract it. Use 3 lone stars on lower flap. Split the straps. Free the middle of the thyroid. Use middle finger on gauze to retract thyroid towards you. Use a ladyfinger to retract straps. Bipolar through fascia. When you approach superior pole, hug gland.

Dissect to find mylohyoid/digastric tendon junction. If you first find the ant. belly of digastric, follow it posteriorly to digastric tendon. Then tunnel under DG tendon to free the entire length of posterior margin of mylohyoid. Retract mylohyoid anteriorly. This exposes the Ranine vein and the hypoglossal nerve.\nIsolate nerve fibers of hypoglossal nerve. Use bipolar NIM electrode to determine inclusion (GGh, GGo, T/V)/exclusion (HG/SG) fibers.

Attendings typically operate for \u00bd days at a time so surgeries in the AM may go as early as 7:30 and surgeries in the PM may go as early as 12:00\nYou don\u2019t have dictation privileges at any of the hospitals, so you will not be able to dictate op notes\nIf any patients are admitted, ask the attending if you should check on them the following day(s). (Sometimes you have surgeries all day that would prevent you from seeing the patient early, therefore if another physician is at that location, he/she may see the patient.) Depending on the hospital and attending, the patient may be admitted to the hospitalist service. If so, they will take care of the discharge paperwork. If not and you have access to the EMR, please assist in discharging the patient.\n\nClinic responsibilities\n\nThere are 4 clinic locations: Brockton, Norwood, Taunton, and Plainville.\nThere are several office procedures that may be listed on the weekly schedule as well; these are usually thyroid ultrasounds with Dr. Dhingra or in-office balloon sinuplasties with Dr. Pradhan/O\u2019Brien\nMake every effort to attend these sessions, unless you are seeing urgent consults\n\nConsult responsibilities\n\nThe Brockton resident is responsible for fielding all daytime consults between 8 AM and 5 PM\nUsually the office will call you directly with the consult, but occasionally attendings may also ask you directly\nDuring regional meetings (NEOS, Alumni Day) you are responsible for triaging consults but not seeing them. If any consult needs to be seen urgently, please discuss this with the on-call attending to make a plan. During national meetings (outside Boston) you are not responsible for triaging consults.\nOn Wednesdays, after 12:00pm all consults should get deferred to the attending on-call due to didactics. You are not expected to triage any phone calls as well.\n\nOn the weekend, call begins Saturday 8 AM and ends Monday 8 AM. Download the OnPage app on your phone to setup the weekend call service. You will receive pages through the app regarding mommy calls and consults. If calls are not getting sent to you (they are erroneously being sent to the attending) or you think there is a glitch, call VIP Connections at 866-270-1030.\n\nCall the on-call attending Saturday morning at 8 AM to receive sign out regarding overnight events.\nFor mommy calls and to establish f/u for hospital patients, recommend the patients call 508-588-8034 to arrange f/u\nUrgent consults (e.g. airway, bleeding, or anything needing same-day operative intervention) should be seen ASAP\nIf an urgent consult conflicts with either a case or clinic session, call that attending directly to explain the situation and figure out a plan (i.e. seeing it yourself and being late to case, or asking an attending at the nearest clinic to see the consult)\nNon-urgent consults (e.g. PTAs, dysphagia, sinusitis, epistaxis s/p packing, etc.) may be seen at your convenience, essentially within 24 hours\nYou may not need to see some non-urgent consults by either arranging outpatient follow up OR referring them to the nearest clinic (for the latter, make sure to call the clinic directly to see if an attending is willing to see someone as an add-on, PTAs can fall under this category)\nAll consults should be discussed with an attending. Staffing a consult is at the discretion of the attending.\nResidents cannot see patients by themselves at Sturdy Hospital; usually the attendings will see consults there on their own, but sometimes they will request you meet them there to see a consult (which is OK since technically at that point you\u2019re \u201csupervised\u201d)\nResidents cannot see patients at Beth Israel Needham. For any calls from this institution, please contact the on-call attending\n\n\n\nWhere to find scopes\n\nFlexible laryngoscopes are available at every clinic in a travel case (all have portable light sources) during business hours, though it is preferred you obtain them at the hospital\nThere is a flexible scope in the pre-op area at Good Sam with a portable light source; you just need to sign a sheet documenting pick-up and return times. Ask the person at the front desk where to place a dirty scope\nThere is a difficult airway cart at both the Brockton ICU and the Norwood ED, each of which contains a flexible scope; after you\u2019re done, the nurses will help you bag the dirty scope to be sent for cleaning\nMorton Hospital does not have any flexible scopes; you should either get one from the clinic inside the hospital (during business hours) or bring your own from another site (nights and weekends)\n\nEMR Remote Access use your login ins to view images/access meditech from home\nNorwood/Good Sam/Morton: https://citrix.steward.org/vpn/index.html\nBrockton: https://citrix.signature-healthcare.org/Citrix/XenApp/\nPhone numbers/addresses/door code\n\n\nBrockton office:\n\n\n35 Pearl St, Suite #200, Brockton, MA\n\n(508) 588-8034\nBackline: (508) 584-1186\n\n\n\n\n\nNorwood office:\n\n\n825 Washington St, Suite #310, Norwood, MA\n\n(781) 769-8910\n\nPlainville office:\n\n\n188 Washington St, Plainville, MA\n\n(508) 699-1701\n\nTaunton office:\n\n\n72 Washington St, Suite #1600, Taunton, MA\n\n(508) 880-3460\n\nTina Carroll:\n\n\n1st floor (Brockton office)\n\n(508) 588-2750\n\nCathy Dwinnells:\n\n\nNorwood office\n\n(781) 769-3222 ext 2332\n\nBrockton Hospital:\n\n\n680 Centre St, Brockton, MA\n\n(508) 941-7000\nOR locker room: 7373\n\nGood Samaritan Medical Center:\n\n\n235 N Pearl St, Brockton, MA\n\n(508) 427-3000\nED: 1234*\nOR locker room: 531\nClean supply: 3278\n\nNorwood Hospital:\n\n\n800 Washington St, Norwood, MA\n\n(781) 769-4000\n\nMorton Hospital:\n\n\n88 Washington St, Taunton, MA\n\n(508) 828-7000\nOR Front Desk: (508) 828-7130\nCall anesthesia AND nursing supervisor for takebacks to OR over weekend\n\nSturdy Hospital:\n\n\n211 Park St, Attleboro, MA\n\n(508) 222-5200\n\nAttending Phone Numbers\n\nDr. J.

You split call with the MEEI,BI, and BMC residents rotating with you. Twice a month, a moonlighter covers call (FYI Tufts residents can moonlight. Its $2000 for the day. Just make sure the MEEI residents know your interested)\nThe schedule is set by the MEEI resident. The goal is to maximize the amount of golden weekend you have (that is when you are on call Thursday night so you are off Friday morning until Monday morning).\nYou can take 1 week of vacation during this block.\nAlanna Boyson Alanna.Boyson@childrens.harvard.edu organizes the rotation. She will give you a packet with the expectations and specific details regarding the rotation\n\n\nGeneral Rules for your on-call nights\n\n\nSee every consult even if its dumb\nYou have to perform post-op checks on every patient that was operated on. Try and do these in-between cases during the day. This will save you a ton of time.\nDon\u2019t do any procedures (including fiberoptic scopes) on any patient until you have cleared it with the fellow on call\nYou have to send out an updated list and the overnight events in the morning e-mail so keep a running list of the phone calls/consults as they come in.\nFor phone-calls, document them in the EMR\nWhen you get called about the post-T&amp;A patient in agony because they don\u2019t have any narcotic meds (which happens A LOT cuz most attendings only give ibu/tyl), check if they are unable to tolerate any PO and are dehydrated (if yes then they go to the ED). If they are in-between, you can reduce the freq of Tylenol from q6 to q4 to get them through the night.\nYou are responsible for the AM progress notes. Skeletonize all the notes in the evening and save them. You should start rounding on your patients at around 4am so you don\u2019t get caught by a 5 or 6am ED consult. They will ask you to look in the mouth of every post T&amp;A patient. You\u2019ll realize that its impossible to do that.\nOnce you finish rounding, update the notes and the list and send out the morning email\nTable rounds are typically at 7am in the morning in the side room by the Starbucks. The team, including you, round on the most active patients. After you round, you can update any notes that need to be updated before sending them to the fellow to be signed.\n\nLaryngoscope, Bronchoscope, Esophagoscope Sizing\n\n\nAntibiotic Coverage\n\nAntibiogram\n\n\nQuick Anatomy\nNerve Blocks for Laceration Repairs\n\nFigure 17: Above: Blocks for facial lacerations.

Have ED sedate children. (1) Get all your supplies ready: facial plastics kit (ENT minor from OR at Tufts) Pull twice the amount of sutures that you think you\u2019ll need (typically 4-0 chromic on SH for oral mucosa, 4-0 vicyrl on RB-1 or SH for deep, 5-0 fast absorbing for skin), saline, 60cc syringe, 18G &amp; long 27G needle (for drawing up &amp; injecting lido), betadine, 15 blade, tons of 4x4, eye cautery (if it\u2019s a big lac with lots of bleeding). (2) inject, washout, debride, prep. Remove all foreign objects. (3) undermine and freshen edges (4) reapproximate normal landmarks first with deep stitches (5) evert edges with superficial closure.\nProphylaxis:\n\nTetanus: give booster for most wound (unless patient has received one in last 10 years). Give tetanus immunoglobin for high risk injuries.\nAntibiotics: I would give 5 days of Keflex and antibiotic ointment. Augmentin is better if oropharyngeal mucosa is damaged.\n\nHematomas: Small can be observed. Large hematomas must be evacuated to avoid pressure necrosis. Early hematomas can\u2019t be aspirated w/ a needle because its like jello \u2013 you have to cut them open. After a week, can needle aspirate\nLocal Rotational Flaps\nFigure 18: Top: Medscape.com.

    "content": "Calls\nPost-tonsillectomy patients\n\nBleeding: Ask all tonsil bleeds to go to an ED. If sounds like a large active bleed, they go to the nearest ED, otherwise they come to us.\nFever: Fever is expected for up to 2 weeks. If fever continues, can consider course of azithromycin (sometimes adenoid bed can become infected)\nNeck Pain: A small amount of neck pain is expected (typically from suspension or the adenoidectomy). If the patient cannot move their neck, send patient to ED for CT to r/o Grisel\u2019s syndrome (especially if patient has down syndrome)\nPain: check if patient has been able to receive pain meds (often parents can\u2019t get kids to drink the meds). Offer PR Tylenol to help catch up pain\n\nPost Septorhinoplasty Q&amp;A\n\nDuration of swelling/bruising: 7-10days. Ways to reduce: sit up, apply ice\nWhen can I blow nose? gentile blowing starts 1-week post-op\nWhen should nasal drainage stop? 2-3 days postop\nWhen can I resume sports: light exercise 2-3 weeks. Sports where nose could be injured (ball-sports/contact sports) 3 months.\nWhen does nasal fullness/congestion subside? few weeks to a month\nWhen can I return to work? Probably 1 week. Sooner if they are up to it but need to take it easy w/ lifting and moving\nCan I use my CPAP post-op? No (especially if cosmetic or osteotomies are performed since mask sits on nose + packing is in nose). May be able to start after packing removed at 1-week post-op check (Dr. Lee is typically okay once packing comes out). Tell patients to sit up or discuss with sleep specialist\nWhen can I wear sunglasses? Can wear them over splint. Once splint comes off, if possible, try and avoid glasses on bridge of nose for another 1 week (especially if osteotomies done) but can wear them if needed \u2013 just try and take them off for small periods of time.\nWhen can I fly? 2-3 weeks post-op\n\nPost-Ear Surgery Restrictions\n\nGlasscock dressing: 1-2 days\nFor Dr. Sillman: Glasscock/cotton bud in ear is removed after 2 days, then ear drops started\nSinus precautions: 2 weeks\nRestrictions on flying: 2-3 weeks\nRestriction on scuba diving: for stapedectomy - forever\nDry ear precautions: 6 weeks\n\nSinus Surgery Restrictions\n\nSinus precautions for 2-3 weeks\nAvoid flying for 2-3 weeks\n\nTravel Restrictions:\n\nAvoid flying for:\nSinus surgery or septorhinoplasty \u2014 2-3 weeks\nEar surgery (except tubes) \u2014 2-3 weeks\nStapedectomy \u2014 2 weeks for Dr. Sillman (6-8 weeks: most other Otologists)\nAvoid travelling far from hospital\n\n\nTonsillectomies: 2 weeks\n\nPost-Op Precautions\nDry ear precautions\n\nBefore showering, coat a small piece of cotton with a tablespoon of Vaseline ointment. Gently insert the cotton ball into the ear canal and keep in for the duration of the shower.\nIf swimming or bathing is desired, purchase earplugs and a headband to keep earplugs from falling out.\n\nSinus Precautions\n\nBlowing your nose: Do not pinch your nose: do not blow your nose. You can gently wipe your nose if needed.\nSneezing: If you must sneeze, keep your mouth open and do not pinch your nose closed.\nSucking in air/liquid: Do not drink though a straw. Do not smoke.\nBlowing out air: Do not play a wind instrument. Do not blow up balloons.\nPushing or lifting: Do not lift or push objects weighing more than 20 pounds. Avoid strenuous activity. Please use soft softeners.\nBending over: Keep your head above the level of your heart. Sleep with your head slightly raised\n\nBack to homepage"

    "content": "Consults\nEpistaxis\n\nMost bleeds stop with Afrin soaked cotton and pressure.\nCheck for hx of malignancy, trauma, HTN, family hx, dry environment, cocaine use. Check the BP, coags, platelets. Find out which side the bleed started\nBring epistaxis kit: 0-degree rigid scope, phenylephrine+lidocaine, pledgets, surgicel, Surgifoam, Bactroban, ant/post rhinorocket (7.5cm), nasal speculum, bayonet forceps, #7 &amp; #9 Frazier tip suction, silver nitrate cautery.\nCan bring thrombigel or ask the ED to send for Surgiflo if you want to get fancy\nThink posterior bleeds if the patient is post-surgical or there is a hx of malignancy or trauma. Also, can hide on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate (where the SPA comes out from behind the maxillary sinus)\nFor posterior bleeds, can use:\n10F Foley \u2013 Put into nasopharynx down to oropharynx, inflate w/ 10cc, pull until balloon wedges against choanae. Clamp or tape at nasal alar. Monitor for palate necrosis\nEpistat \u2013 put into nasopharynx. Inflate posterior balloon with 7-10cc of sterile water. Withdraw until balloon wedges against posterior nasal cavity, inflate anterior balloon with 15-30cc.\nAnt/Posterior Rapid Rhino (7.5cm) \u2013 works well. Inflate until the patient can\u2019t tolerate it anymore\nRule of thumb: posterior packing and bilateral packing requires hospital admission and pulse ox monitoring and telemetry (its arrhythmia you are monitoring for)\nIt\u2019s never coming from both sides. If the ED has packed both sides, take at least one of them out.\nED doctors can pack a nose. As an Otolaryngologist, when you see an epistaxis patient, your job is to find out where the bleeding is coming from and why it is happening. Find the bleeding source\n\n\u2022   Soak the lidocaine/phenylephrine neuropatty and using bayonet forceps, gently feed it along the floor of the nasal cavity. You should get about two neuropatties in. They should slide all the way back and not bunch up at the front. Once that is in, have the patient hold pressure for 5-10mins. This will likely stop/slow down most bleeds and numb everything up so that you can look. Use a 0-degree scope and a Frazier tip suction and push the anterior aspect of the neuropatties back bit by bit so that they are wiping the septum just before you visualize it. This will show you where the bleeding is coming from.\n\nIf its anterior and a vessel can be seen, use a silver nitrate stick to cauterize it. Make sure you dry the area before and after cautery with a cotton tip applicator otherwise it will drop down onto patients\u2019 lips and discolor their skin.\nIf its further back (mid septum), wrap surgicel around Surgifoam (add some Bactroban) and press it against the area that\u2019s bleeding.\nIf it\u2019s posterior: use a posterior pack. Pumping vessels posteriorly will likely need to the OR to stop. Try medializing the middle turbinate and looking for the vessel on the lateral posterior aspect of the middle turbinate where the SPA comes out.\nIf it\u2019s an HHT patient. Surgiflo seems to work best. Just coat the entire nasal cavity with it.\n\nPTAs\n\nCBC w/ Diff; Rapid Strep; Monospot\nDecadron 10 mg IV x 1 (only if drained or neg needle aspiration + neg CT for abscess;\nUnasyn IV or Clindamycin (PCN allergic) x1 only if CBC shows no atypical lymphocytes &amp; monospot is negative; then continue PO x 7-14 days\nTo Drain: yankeur suction at bedside, 18-gauge needle, &gt;27-gauge needle, 10 mL syringe, 5 mL syringe, lidocaine with epi, tongue depressor, 15 blade, Kelly clamp, hurricane spray\nHurricane spray -&gt; lido w/ epi -&gt; You can needle aspirate to localize the region. March down the side of the peritonsillar space, it can be lower than you think. When you strike gold, send it for culture, then do an I&amp;D w/ a #15 blade and spread with clamp.\nLow threshold to scope (unless you have a CT) to clear the airway as edema can track down\n\nTracheostomy\n\n\nFamily discussion completed by primary team (you aren\u2019t responsible for that talk)\n\n\nCoagulation\n\nPlatelet, H/H, INR/PTT\nAnticoagulation (why? Can it be shut off) \u2013 lovenox stop 24hrs before, heparin gtt 4-5 hours before - see anticoagulation guide\nIntubation hx (PEEP (PEEP &gt;8 makes trachs much more difficult \u2013 pts quickly desat, trach has higher risk of dislodging) duration, traumatic? Tube size? Extubation attempts, exposure)\nOperative Steps: Place shoulder roll. mark out midline, hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, sternal notch. Match a 3-4cm incision between cricoid and sternal notch. Inject w/ lido w/ epi. Prep &amp; drape. Incision w/ 15 blade through platysma. Use bipolar to stop skin bleeders. Use sennas on superior and inferior aspects of incision and pull up. Everything that comes up is safe. Push down w/ curved mets midline open (in superior/inferior direction) a little. Don\u2019t open to wide (you\u2019ll get bleeding. Keep doing that until you see straps. Always look for bleeding vessels. Keep palpating for midline. Once you see straps. Use pickups on either side of midline raphe. Develop planes under straps then can retract laterally first with senns then with army navy. If trach dives deep, comes from above thyroid over cricoid. Can also use bovie to separate thyroid. Careful with FiO2 and bovie coming up to the trachea. Switch to bipolar if you have to use it. Push fascia off trachea w/ a peanut. Expose you window (2/3rd tracheal rings). Ask anesthesia to prepare circuit. Ask scrub tech to test cuff, put 10cc syringe on cuff of trach, put on obturator, get a 15 blade, ask anesthesia to lower cuff. Open trachea (careful not to cut cuff) by making two horizontal incisions over 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Widen with curved mets. Use a pickup to hold piece of trachea between cuts and use heavy mayos to cut the sides of the incision to remove window. Widen w/ trach spreaders. Ask anesthesia to withdraw circuit until it\u2019s just above window then, if you have time, place a stay suture inferiorly and superiorly. Place trach, place inner cannula, inflate cuff, connect anesthesia circuit, wait for CO2 return, secure trach w/ 4-point sutures &amp; Velcro trach tie.\n\nAngioedema\n\nLook for watery edema of the uvula or lip edema.\nAlways scope to r/o airway edema.\nLabs: get complement protein, C4 levels, and C1-INH (low levels -&gt; suspect C1 esterase deficiency).\nAlso get CBC, Chem10, LFTs, CRP, ESR\nCauses: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), NSAIDs\nTime frame: Histamine related - comes &amp; goes within 12 hours\nLisinopril related \u2013 can take 2 days for swelling to decrease\nHereditary angioedema \u2013 can take DAYS\nRec: Racemic Epi, Heliox, IV decadron, H1/H2 blockers.\n\nIf hereditary angioedema, can consider:\n\nPurified C1 inhibitor concentrate (Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest).\nEcallantide (Kalbitor) (a kallikrein inhibitor)\nIcatibant (Firazyr), a bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist\nIf significant airway edema, prophylactically intubate, otherwise admit to MICU overnight for airway monitoring and rescope in morning\nHave a game plan for intubation \u2013 speak to Anesthesia to notify that patient is being admitted, provide plan for intubation, nasotracheal, fiberoptic etc.\n\n\n\nParotitis/Sialadenitis\n\nMASH: Massage, antibiotics, sialagogues (lemon drops, orange wedges), hydration/heat.\n\nEar Foreign Body\n\nAlways ask about hearing. If there is hearing loss, r/o SNHL with tuning fork exam\nAsk the ED to perform ketamine sedation. Giving a benzo (Ativan) is rarely enough\nGet a loop curette and bend it to 45 degrees, try and get it behind the foreign body and pop it out\nIf the foreign body is an organic material such as popcorn, avoid putting in drops as this could cause the foreign body to swell\n\nFish Bone\n\nDo a fiberoptic exam. If you can\u2019t see it, offer a thin-cut CT w/o contrast through the larynx\nIf fishbone is visible, have the patient inhale 4cc of 4% lidocaine, use hurricane spray and a uro-jet (viscous lidocaine) to numb the posterior oropharynx\nUse the ED scope or bring a tower from clinic and get McGill forceps\nHave a nurse wrap patient\u2019s tongue with gauze and pull it out to improve access.\nFor children, it\u2019s often easier to go to the OR.\n\nOrbital Cellulitis\n\n\nPreseptal vs Orbital Cellulitis:\n\n\nOrbital cellulitis is likely to have chemosis, pain with EOMI, restricted eye movement\n\n\nWhen to drain a subperiosteal abscess?\n\n\nIf the abscess volume is &lt;1250mm3 can avoid OR (measure abscess in 3 dimensions WxDxL in mm)\n\n\nHow to tell if there is a cavernous sinus thrombosis: get a MRI with contrast.\n\n\nLook at DTI/DWI (isoDTI) - if the Cavernous sinus lights up, strong indication for Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Look for edema. If in the vessels, think of thrombophlebitis.\n\nRule out shine through.  ADC map (dDTI) should be the opposite of the DWI (isoDTI) if it\u2019s true. If they are the same, this is shine through effect.\n\n\nOn T1 post contrast - look for filling defect. Then confirm on DWI.\n1-2mm should be size of superior ophthalmic vein. Expect it to be dilated on both sides\n\n\n\nAirway patients with stridor\n\nAsk: onset of stridor + speed of progression. Eval for infectious vs inflammatory vs foreign body vs neoplastic\nEvaluate: O2 sat, respiratory rate, retractions, ability to lay supine. Stridor: insp: supraglottic/glottic. Biphasic: glottic/subglottic. Expiratory: trachea/bronchi. Perform fiberoptic exam and check airway\n\nManagement:\n\n\nAirway widely patent and mild edema, slow progression of symptoms \u2192 observation on floor w/ O2 monitoring\n\nAirway patent but moderate edema (e.g. angioedema patients) \u2192 observation in ICU\nUnable to entire airway \u2192 OR for awake fiberoptic intubation w/ possible awake trach\nUnable to see any airway \u2192 OR for awake trach\n\n==Surgical Airway Patients==\n\n\nAlert an attending\n\nNasal trumpet, Heliox if increased WOB\nBag Mask (may not be the best) or LMA\nIf stable, perform fiberoptic exam. If intubation needed, try and do in OR\n\nPediatric Stridor\n\nScope with nursing and bag mask equipment available. Always ask the NICU RN before you even touch a kid in the NICU\nWhen you scope, scope around the nasal cannula, don\u2019t remove it\nNo reflux medications in NICU babies unless the attending clears it (causes NEC)\n\nDDX:\n\n\nLaryngomalacia\n\nVF immobility: see VF immobility workup in Pedi ENT section\nComplete tracheal rings\nGet echo, head u/s +/- MRI\nMBS if VF immobility\nLow threshold for DLB\n\n\n\nTransfers\n\nNever accept an unstable transfer.\nNo direct admits unless one of our attendings has accepted it. In general, transfers go through the ED\n\nAdmissions from ED\nIn general, we have adopted the same model as Orthopedics.\n\nAdmit to Medicine with ENT consult: Adults with non-surgical issue (peritonsillar phlegmon, angioedema) or surgical issue + multiple co-morbidities (taking medications for T2DM and HTN) or is high risk (history of MI)\nAdmit to ENT: Adults with non-complicated surgical patients (e.g.: retropharyngeal abscess) and those with post-op complications (unless it is purely medical e.g. poor PO intake, pain control etc.).\nAdmit to Pediatrics: Typically, all pediatric patients except those with post-surgical complications go to Pediatrics\n\nGeneral rule: Be reasonable. Medicine are reasonable\u2026which means they tend to get dumped on a lot. We should take the simple patients onto our service. At the same time, recognize that we are in the ORs during the day and are home-call at night so don\u2019t have the manpower to manage difficult patients.\nInpatient or bedded outpatient patients who had surgery: they come to our service."

    "content": "Rules of the Game\nThe goal of residency is avoiding phone calls and avoiding pages\nBuild your differential: mistakes happen when you prematurely close on a diagnosis. R/O the worst-case scenarios\nNever make assumptions.\nIf you delegate work, you are still responsible for following up on the result\nEscalate any clinical changes in a patient to a senior resident or attending. This is not just to CYA but to avoid mistakes. Two eyes are better than one\nText out to the other residents for any consults, new ED or post-op admissions.\nEveryone\u2019s time is valuable. No matter what level of training you are, no job is above or beneath you. Don\u2019t ask others to do your busy work. No-one is going to clean up your mess.\nHelp the PGY-2. It\u2019s a small service so if anyone isn\u2019t pulling their weight things fall apart.\u00a0 We are our own checks and balances.\nTeach: You have an obligation to pass on your knowledge to the residents, interns, and medical students under you. If you present, make sure you give people 3-4 take away points.\nBe prepared for every case: Pretend there is no attending with you.\nWhen you present to an attending, give just the meat \u2013 tell them what symptoms the patient has before telling them what the patient doesn\u2019t have**.**\nDon\u2019t miss didactics. The service as a team must protect this time.\nTemporal bones don\u2019t drill themselves \u2013 but they want to be drilled. Keep the temporal bone lab in good working order and harvest bones in the Spring\nTreat every day like a job interview \u2013 The attendings notice when you work hard and when you slack off. Ultimately, their opinion of you dictates your ability to get a job/match into a fellowship after residency.\nUpdate the guide: every time you think \u201cthis would be useful for the pocketbook,\u201d add it in. This doesn\u2019t update itself.\nTry and improve every aspect of our program. Everyone has to do their bit to leave this program better off than when you came.\nBack to homepage"

Inject methylene blue with the 30 gauge needle circumferentially. This MUST be in the dermal plane, as that\u2019s where the lymphatics are.\nYou should see the methylene blue splay underneath the skin.\nInject, prep, drape. This is generally not a full neck dissection. \\n This will usually be a 2\u20133cm incision, dissect to find the LN using the NeoProbe to check on location, and find the LN.\nFind the LN. Note, this may NOT appear like a pathologic LN. \\n This may be a subcentimeter LN that has some slight hypervascularity/blue tint.\nTest the LN on the back table.\nIf you have the right LN, the NeoProbe should register at the same level as before.\nTest the bed in which the LN came from.\nThe surrounding areas should not register more than 20% of the original high-registering value (some people say 10% of highest value).\nIf it does, there are more LN to get.\nClose.\n\nLee \u2013 Skin Grafting\n\nPrep out the thigh (usually right thigh) using Chlorhexidine. Try to find an area of the thigh that is most flat and without skin lesions. Drape using an upside down half sheet. Place a folded blue towel with a clamp on it over the prepped thigh. This ultimately gets covered with the over-drape, but the blue towel and clamp makes it easy to find when you\u2019re ready to take the skin graft.\nWhen it\u2019s time, feel the clamp, cut out the area with scissors. Staple the edges of the over-drape down.\nMeasure out the skin graft (extra 1-2 cm in both directions). Rub mineral oil over the thigh. We use mineral oil because (1) it will not become rancid and (2) it smooths the area for easy skin graft harvesting.\nPreparing the skin graft blade: for STSG, Dr. Lee likes to set it somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3 inches. You should be able to fit a flat 15-blade between the blade and the machine; this will give you a good split thickness skin graft width if you can\u2019t remember 0.2\u20130.3 or if you\u2019re using a different machine.\nChoose the width gauge that is roughly 1\u20132cm larger than what you need.\nPlace the skin graft machine on the thigh at an angle dictated by the side piece (there is a slight angle to the width gauge; roughly 20\u201330 degrees). Press relatively firmly and push forward. Use DeBakey\u2019s to grasp the skin graft.\nAgain, cut the graft so it is roughly 1\u20132cm longer than what you think you need. You do NOT need to mesh the graft. You will cut a few drainage holes in it once the graft is attached. You will likely bolster it down with cotton dipped in mineral oil wrapped in Xeroform, held down by silk ties. The skin graft site will be covered by a large Allevyn dressing, which stays there for one week.\n\nLee \u2013 Post Mohs Reconstruction\nFlap Types\n\n\nPivotal\n\n\nRotation: eg cervicofacial advancement, O-to-Z\n\nTranspositional: eg bilobed and rhombic\nInterpolation: base of flap bridges over tissue: eg paramedian\nIsland: eg V-to-Y island flap\n\nAdvancement\n\n\nUnipedicle. Eg mesolabial\n\nBilobed advancement\nV-to-Y advancement flap\n\n\nBEST LOCAL FLAP FOR LOCATION\n\nSCALP: STSG or rotation flapsA. &gt;6cm + partial thickness: STSGB. &lt;6cm: Consider O-T or O-Z flaps (this is because two rotation flaps are used in OT &amp; OZ flaps: Arc of scalp should be 4 times the diameter of defect)\nFOREHEAD\nMidline: Can close primarily in a vertical orientation (&lt;1cm).Dissect in subgaleal plane.\nParamedian/Lateral: do bilateral advancement flaps. Dissect in superficial plane to avoid supratrochlear/supraorbital nerves\nMEDIAL CHEEK\nAbove Ala: Transposition flaps (rhomboid) with lines in the melolabial/labial mandibular creases\n\nAt or below level of ala: V-to-Y island flap (imagine the defect is the base of a triangle and that the other two sides of the triangle close together).\n\nWidth of skin triangle = wide of defect at widest point. Have the length be TWICE length of defect. Have triangle in the direction of the mesolabial groove.\nUndermine 2 cm in all directions.\nCut all three limbs of triangle. Blood supply is from deep (at least 1/3 of skin island must have deep attachments. Cut defect to fit graft)\nLATERAL CHEEK\nSmall defects: transposition flap (rhomboid).\nLarge defects: rotation advancement flap (cervicofacial advancement)\nLIP\nCentral lip/philtrum: bilateral advancement flap with incision on vermillion border\nLateral lip: rotation flap. Not from medial cheek to maintain melolabial crease\nNOSE\nAnterior aspect of alar groove: island pedicle flap\nNasal tip or nasal dorsum/sidewall: bilobed flap (max for 1\u20131.5cm defects)\n\n\n"

    "content": "\nHead &amp; Neck -- OR\nGuide\n\nDr.\nTracy's Radial Forearm Free Flap\nRaising the flap\nPrep:\nShave arm\nPrep arm, shoulder, chest with Chloraprep while someone holds the\narm, and prep the head and neck in the usual fashion\nTuck half sheet covered with towels under the flank. Arm needs to\nrest on arm board, place sterile drape on arm board.\nPlace a towel around the armpit and use Edna to clip it. Then, wrap a\nsponge around the thumb to supinate the forearm and clip the sponge to\nthe arm board with an Edna.\nThen cover the arm with towel to keep sterile.\nDr.\u00a0Tracy will then wrap the arm with an elastic wrap to drain it off\nits venous supply. Then the tourniquet will be applied as a setting of\n250 and a timer for 1 hour starts.\nBegin by incising the lateral aspect of the skin paddle to find the\nCephalic vein which is preserved and follow it all the way up to the\nantecubital fossa. Next use forceps to find the vascular pedicle then\nyou can raise the flap on the contralateral side and isolate and tie off\nthe vascular pedicle and start lifting the flap\n\nDr.\u00a0O'Leary's\nThyroidectomy\nLaryngeal nerve monitoring tube is needed and the Medtronic NIM\nmonitor. No paralytics, and needs antibiotics. Watch anesthesia's\nglidescope to ensure that the blue stripe is adjacent to the vocal\ncords. Place the gel ax roll as the shoulder roll and recheck the tube\nplacement with the glidescope. Attach the nerve monitor consul at the\nhead of the bed and tape it in place. Ensure that the nerve monitor is\nworking appropriately by tapping in the neck. Mark the neck along a\nnerve crease if possible 2-3 cm above the sternal notch. Inject with 1%\nlidocaine with epi. Prep with betadine.\n\nDr.\u00a0Dhingra's Thyroidectomy\nInject incision in preop.\nMake generous incision 2 inches above the sternum then make the\nincision down past the platysma on both sides and use the Bovie to\ndevelop yourself sub-platysmal flaps. Use your finger as a come hither\nmotion to get them going and work a free edge. Go down to the sternum on\nthe inferior flap. Go up to the cricoid/thyroid notch superiorly.\nThen travel down midline kind of like you would do with a trach. Use\nkelly's to present the midline fascia for someone to divide with the\nbovie.\nKeep going making sure you're a midline until you come down to the\nthyroid. Be careful inferiorly because there is a plexus of vessels and\nbecome very vascular. Here use the ligasure to make sure you don't make\nanything bleed.\nOnce you found the thyroid then you want to work the sternothyroid\noff the thyroid to develop the lateral edge of the thyroid. To do this,\nget two peanuts: one using to retract the thyroid towards you and the\nother to push on the undersurface of the sternothyroid to elevate it\noff. Once you have enough of an edge, ask for the lady finger for\nsomeone to retract. Once you've developed the lateral edge, keep doing\nit up towards the superior pole. Here there are a lot of vessels so be\nsure to use the Ligasure.\nThis is the part to pay attention to: developing the superior pole is\nthe one of three or four critical steps. You should not look for the\nsuperior laryngeal nerve necessarily but you should be cognizant of the\ncricothyroid muscle.\nOnce you have freed the superior pole you can develop the middle a\nlittle bit more but don't get too deep/posterior. This is when you have\nto check to see where your current laryngeal nerve is remember the\ndifferent landmarks.\n\n\n\nLocated in simon's triangle: trachea, carotid, and inferior\nlobe.\n\n\n\nRLN is deep to berry's ligament\n\n\n\nTubercle of Zuckerkandl: RLN is medial to it. Superior thyroid is\nsuperior to it\n\n\n\nLeft RLN is more medial than right RLN. Left RLN is reliably deep\nto inferior thyroid a\n\n\n\nSuperior Parathyroid is posterior to RLN. Inferior parathyroid is\nanterior to RLN\nIn reality you're going to use a snit forcep spreading in the\ndirection of the nerve and using the stimulator. Once you found it\nfollow superiorly and inferiorly see that you are confident of the plane\ntypically people follow it all the way into its insertion.\nOnce you've done that you can free the rest of the middle and\ninferior pole of the thyroid and of the trachea. You can do this\nrelatively quickly as the nerve is protected. Once the thyroid only\nattached to the trachea, use a Kelly and spread along the trachea in the\nmidline superior to inferior (you can use a bovie to take it off the\ntrachea as well as the plane is pretty well developed). Then you can\ntransect half of it and do the otherside. Dump some thrombin soaked\nGelfoam into the resected area close the straps with 3-0 Vicryl. Close\nthe platysma with 4-0 Vicryl and close the wound with a subcuticular 5-0\nMonocryl.\n\nDr Wein Thyroidectomy\nSimilar set up to Dhingra's. When you lift the upper subplatysmal\nflap, roll skin over a wet 4x8 gauze and suture to mandible with 2-0\nsilk to retract it. Use 3 lone stars on lower flap. Split the straps.\nFree the middle of the thyroid. Use middle finger on gauze to retract\nthyroid towards you. Use a ladyfinger to retract straps. Bipolar through\nfascia. When you approach superior pole, hug gland. Dr Wein doesn't\nnecessarily go hunting for the nerve\n\nDr Wein INSPIRE Hypoglossal Nerve Implants\nSet Up:\n\n\n\nPatient rotated 180. Tube taped to the left\n\n\n\nPlace shoulder roll. Tuck right arm. Leave mouth\nopen\n\n\n\nNIM Monitor (NIM 3.0): 3 lead setup:\n\n\n\nLeads 1 &amp; 2 go into tongue (include=blue,\nexclude=red)\n\n\n\nLead 3 (purple) goes into marginal mandibular\n\nFigure 11: INSPIRE Implant Training, 2016\nIncisions:\nNeck: 4-6cm starting from anterior aspect of submandibular gland to\n\\~1cm from midline.\nMark EJ, SMG, midline, hyoid, mandible\nImplant Pocket: 5cm inferior to clavicle. 5.5cm in length.

Dissect to find\nmylohyoid/digastric tendon junction. If you first find the ant. belly of\ndigastric, follow it posteriorly to digastric tendon. Then tunnel under\nDG tendon to free the entire length of posterior margin of mylohyoid.\nRetract mylohyoid anteriorly. This exposes the Ranine vein and the\nhypoglossal nerve.\nIsolate nerve fibers of hypoglossal nerve. Use bipolar NIM electrode\nto determine inclusion (GGh, GGo, T/V)/exclusion (HG/SG) fibers. Use\nvessel loop to help retract nerve to pass stimulator cuff around\ninclusion fibers\nPass stimulator under digastric tendon then tie stimulation lead to\nanterior belly of digastric.

If atypical mycobacteria, consider surgical excision otherwise consider trial of antibiotics\nAdditional labs to consider: Toxoplasmosis, Tularemia (rabits), Brucella (cows/pigs), ACE levels (Sarcoid)\n\nAcquired + suspicious for malignancy (eg HL): consider CBC, CXR, CT and excise\n\nCONGENITAL NECK MASSES\nThyroglossal Duct cysts:\n\nGet Thyroid U/S to evaluate for thyroid tissue (1% of patients, TDC will be only thyroid tissue)\nExcision: Sistrunk: get mid portion of hyoid and cuff of tongue base (see Posterior hyoid space as related to excision of the thyroglossal duct cyst. J Maddalozzo, J Alderfer, V Modi - The Laryngoscope, 2010)\n\nThymic cysts:\n\n always on the left side and are cysts. Consider if patient has a macrocystic lymphatic malformation but no loculations (LVMs are multiple cysts, Thymic cysts are a single cyst). Get serial calcium and eval for Consider DiGeorge Syndrome\n\nCongenital Torticollis (SCM tumors of infancy):\n\nconsider in patients with fibrous tissue within SCM. Typically increases in size for 2-3 months then regresses for 4-8 months. Typically disappears w/ physiotherapy.\n\nBranchial Cleft Cyst\nFirst Branchial Cleft Cysts:\n\nType 1: 1 layer (ectoderm): Present as pre or post-auricular masses. Runs along EAC. Lateral to CN7\n\n Type 2: 2 layers (ectoderm + mesoderm) \u2190 More common\n\n\nAngle of mandible \u2192 Ends in/near EAC. Can be medial to CN7 and may require a superficial parotidectomy (NIM monitoring required)\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Branchial Cleft: Deep to CN7 (2nd arch). Superficial to CN9 (3rd arch)\nAnterior border of SCM \u2192 Between carotids \u2192 Superficial to CN9, CN12 \u2192 Tonsillar Fossa\nTreatment: Excision, may need tonsillectomy\nThird Branchial Cleft: Deep to CN9 (3rdarch). Superficial to CN10. Ends in piriform\nFourth Branchial Cleft: Starts by clavicle/base of SCM \u2192 loops under subclavian or aortic arch \u2192 goes superiorly deep to carotids \u2192 loops around CN12 and goes to piriform sinus like 3rd branchial cleft cysts\nTreatment of 3rd &amp; 4th Branchial Cleft cysts\n\nEndoscopic Cauterization of Piriform Sinus Tract: Success rates similar to open technique. Occasionally needs 2 or 3 treatments\n\nEspecially good for patients who are revisions or have had multiple infections (lots of scarring in neck)\nUse a 5 Fr Bugbee dome-tipped electrode. Use a setting of 8 on the Valleylab electrosurgical unit. Can throw a simple interrupted with a 6-0 or 7-0 polyglactin suture (Endoscopic electrocauterization of pyriform fossa sinus tracts as definitive treatment, EY Chen et al IJPORL 2009)\nOpen excision should include partial thyroidectomy (superior pole of affected side)\n\n\n\nINFECTIOUS/INFLAMMATORY NECK MASSES\n\nViral: Post-infectious (especially after EBV infections). EBV also helpful to r/o Postransplantation lymphproliferative disease (PTLD)\nBacterial:\n\n\nSuppurative lymphadenopathy: Staph and Group A strep are MCC. Cover for anaerobic (19%) and MRSA (34%)\nCat-Scratch (Bartonella): Treat with azithromycin\nTularemia: via rabbits. Tonsillitis, pharyngitis, painful LAD, fever, chills, headaches\nBrucella: Cows, pigs, goats, elk and bison weakness, sweating, chills, malaise, headache, backache, and arthralgia typically occur. Afternoon fever peaks\nToxoplasmoisis: look out for myocarditis/pneumoitis. Refer to ID\n\nAtypical mycobacterium (although m. tuberculosis rate is \u2191) Get PPD (cannot distinguish between atypical mycobacterium and TB)\n\n\nTx: Surgical excision vs anti-TB drugs. Surgical excision is typically better since anti-TB drugs need to be taken for 3-12months\n\n\n\nInflammatory:\n\n\nKawasaki: fever x 5days + four of the following:\nCervical LAD (2) Desquamation of hands/feet (3) Exanthum (rash) (4) Conjunctivitis (5) Lip/OC erythema (Strawberry tongue)\nRosai-Dorfman. Looks like mono. Plasma cells and histiocytes in biopsy\nDrug-induced: Phenytoin (also pyrimethamine, allopurinol, phenylbutazone)\nSarcoidosis: Get ACE levels\n\nPEDIATRIC VASCULAR LESIONS\n\nIn general: They grow at the same rate as the child, do not involute\n\nInfantile Hemangiomas:\n\nCan be present at birth but typically noted after birth (unlike vascular malformations). Enlarge w/ crying/straining. Associated w/ GLUT-1\nPhases\nProliferation: Enlarge to about 80% final size by 12months (rarely grows after 12months)\nInvolution: 50% regress by 5 years, 70% by 7years\nDiagnosis: MRI - high intensity T2, flow voids\n\nIf in beard distribution CNV: think PHACES (posterior fossa, hemangiomas, aorta/cardiac, seye, sternal pits) more common in females\n\nGet cardiac u/s &amp; Head MRI to r/o posterior cranial fossa abnormalities. Possible risk of subglottic hemangiomas (do DLB if any respiratory symptoms)\nTreatment: Propanolol: during proliferative phase (aka under 1yo)\nMake sure no cardiac issues and &gt;5weeks old: consider in-hospital if high risk (concurrent diagnoses, airway symptoms), monitor glucose.\nDose: Start 0.5mg/kg/day (divided into 2-3x/day dosing). Give 1st dose in office. Monitor vitals for 2 hours and check blood sugar. Advance dose by 0.5mg/kk/dose q4days to 2 mg/kg/day as tolerated (many ppl have patients come back when increasing dose to monitor for another 2 hours). Stop after 12 month old (taper over 4 weeks). Stop if patient has illness (n/v) or wheezing from a cold. Once illness has resolved, can resume treatment\nSuperficial: can be treated with Pulse dye laser (PDL)\nSubglottic: Treat with CO2 laser resection\n\n\n\nCongenital Hemangiomas\n\nNot associated with GLUT-1. Typically fully formed at birth. Types:\nRapidly Involuting (RICH): disappear by 18month of age\nNon-involving (NICH): consider embolization and excision once child is school age\n\nKasabach-merrit dx:\n\nUnlike infantile hemangiomas - they do not spontaneously involute\nCause coagulopathy, bleeding risk\n\nLOW FLOW VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS\n\nCapillary Malformations: Presents with Port-Wine stain at birth. Associated with Sturge Weber syndrome: Can involve leptomeninges- risk of seizures, mental retardation. Treatment: Pulse Dye Laser\nVenous malformations: Commonly on the lips. Bluish hue. Can cause consumption coagulopathy. Imaging shows calcifications (phleboliths) because of low flow. Tx Sclerotherapy\nLymphatic Malformations\n\n\nMacrocystic &gt;2cm2. Microcystic &lt;2cm2\n\nStaging: suprahyoid worse than infrahyoid and bilateral is worse than unilateral\n\n\nLateral to lateral canthus\u2014tend to be macrocytic. Medial = microcystic.\n\nSymptoms/Presentation: airway compression (often needs an EXIT procedure if detected in utereo). Painful if infected. Hemorrhage into cyst can cause rapid enlargement\n\nTreatment:\n\n\nSclerotherapy: 100% ethanol, OK-432, doxycycline, bleomycin, Sirolimus\n\nIf suprahyoid, may involve oral/mucosa look for airway swelling w/ therapy\nBest for Macrocystic stage I diseases (microcystic/bilateral is more resistant)\n\n\nMacrocystic posterior neck, infrahyoid, LMs without septations can be observed\nExcision if symptomatic (low recurrence if completely removed but should be conservative)\n\nHIGH FLOW \u2014 ARTERIAL/ARTERIOVENOUS\n\nSmall in childhood then rapid growth with puberty.\nPatients have a bruit. Untreated, can have heart failure\nWorkup: Doppler, CTA. Tx: preop embolization and then resection\n\nMALIGNANT LESIONS\n\nLipomas: mobile\nNeurofibromas: Think family history of NF1 (Chr 17). Look for ocular symptoms (optic gliomas (astrocytomas); Lisch nodules (Hamartomas of iris), axillary/inguinal freckles.\nLymphoma: Hogkins is more common than NHL in the neck: HL = B-symptoms\n"

Mastisol. Betadine. Marking pen. Alcohol swabs. 1% lido with 1:100,000 epi (use 0.5 % with 1:200,000 epi if young infant, ask if in doubt) .\n2 sets of headlights\n\nHave marking pen ready to pre-mark incision \u2013 have alcohol swabs ready if need to erase/remark. Apply mastisol around your operative field. Place the 1000 drapes on all 4 sides. Do a wide prep with betadine. Put on headlight before you scrub. Have bipolar set on 10/10.\nCLOSING \u2013 in general:\n\n4.0 vicryl for deep layers; buried interrupted\n5.0 or 6.0 fast absorbing gut for skin; simple running\n5.0 monocryl if closing skin with subcuticular stitches\nProlene if placing drain\nBacitracin ointment (occasionally dermabond)\n\nSistrunk (Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Excision) Technique: see article Posterior Hyoid Space as Related to Excision of the Thyroglossal Duct Cyst John Maddalozzo, MD, FAAP, FACS, Jeremy Alderfer, MD; Vikash Modi, MD The Laryngoscope 2010\nCochlear Implants (Vecchiotti)\nTo confirm before patient enters room\n\nCheck the patient\u2019s ear in the pre-op area to r/o mucoid effusion.\nMake sure CPD have pulled the cochlear implant instruments kit (there is a special kit for each CI manufacturer), the ear kit, an M&amp;T kit, the Paparella press (for tympmastoids) the Visao drill with a 6 cutting, 3 cutting, 2 coarse diamond and 1 fine diamond drill on the field (a 1.5 fine diamond off the field as well)\nMake sure they have the PURPLE permanent marker on the field (it\u2019s the only one that draws on the Ioban)\nMake sure they have a NIM nerve stimulator (the one where you can change the voltage) on the field\nA big bag of saline and big bag of sterile water handing on the irrigation machine (the one used for the microdebrider). Don\u2019t allow the scrubs to open an actual microdebrider\u2026for their sake.\nMake sure the cochlear instruments have these templates (Cochlear Corp)\nBalance the microscope. Don\u2019t drape it yet.\n  Call audiology and give them the serial numbers for the cochlear implants\nThings to put on the non-sterile side table:\nM&amp;T kit, mastisol, 1000 drapes cut in half (need 5-6), NIM electrodes, tegederms cut in \u00bd, a razor, alcohol prep pads, lidocaine)\n\n\nSet up\n\n\n Bed rotated 180 degrees. Leica microscope at head of bed, tower can be on the scrub side of microscope, NIM monitor and suction on the scrub side by the feet.\nDraw out the BTE template. Draw out the location of the implant using the silicone template. This has to be above the temporal line and make the angle that it sits &gt;45 degrees (Vecchiotti likes it more vertical than usual) from the temporal line. Shave the hair by the proposed implant site.\nDraw a lazy S incision 0.5cm behind the post-auricular crease.\n Place the NIM and curl the leads before you stick the Tegaderm down. Test the monitor. Volume to max, voltage at 0.8.\nPut mastisol where the 1000 drapes will go and put the 1000 drapes down.\nEvaluate the TM with the microscope before you prep.\nPrep a wide area. Get the parts of the 1000 drapes that slip behind each other. put the craniotomy drape (the one that collects fluid) on the patient. Redraw template. Cut the ear out. Then put the Ioban from posterior to anterior pulling the ear forward as you do. Redraw template markings again. Have scrub drape the microscope and the chairs.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n15 blade for incision, carry down to the temporalis fascia. Raise supraperiosteal flaps anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the EAC.\nCreate a palva flap \u2013 use a bovie (if no contralateral implant placed) down to the bone. Raise the flap with a Lempert periosteal elevator to the spine of henle.\n Do a cortical mastoidectomy, focus on the corner where the tegmen and EAC meet. Use a #6 until you hit Koerner septum, then switch to a #3 to expose the lateral semicircular canal, incus buttress and the fossa incudes. The incus points to the facial recess. Use the facial nerve stimulator to get an idea where the facial nerve is, then take down the air cells on the EAC (your gonna take corda) to get through the facial recess. Expose round window. Drill part of your cochlostomy with a 1 diamond burr anterior/inferior to round window until you are about to pop through it then stop.\nUse a freer to create your pocket (make it small/tight. He\u2019ll pimp you on what is keeps the implant from moving. The answer is the temporalis tendon blocks the anterior/inferior corner of the implant from migrating) Put the metal implant template on a Kelly and use that to dissect the pocket for a good fit. Use a pen to mark a line from the metal template to the mastoid cavity and use a 3 cutting burr to drill a well for the electrodes. Take some temporalis fascia for later\nIrrigate the mastoid. Ask for blue towels to put around the sterile area and change gloves. Open to the cochlear implant. Ask the nurses to disconnect the bovie and the circulator to order the portable x-ray\nUse the #1 diamond burr to finish your cochleostomy. Hold the implant fin with AOS forceps and put the implant into the cochleostomy until you hit the Silastic stopper. Then advance the electrodes, stop if you feel resistance, until the white tabs line up. Pack the cochleostomy\nUse non-compressed gelfoam to pack the mastoid. Close palva flap with running 4-0 vicryl. Close deep layer with 4-0 vicyrl. Superficial with a 5-0 fast absorbing plain gut, use dermabond over that. Use a kerlex for fluffs. Then do a mastoid dressing (with 2 kerlexs)\n\n\nPost-op Instructions\n\n\nMastoid/glasscock dressing for 24 hours. Then glasscock dressing at night until follow up\nKeflex until f/u (give a refill on script)\nHOB &gt;30 degrees. Sinus precautions. Dry ear precautions\nCall for fevers, chills, drainage, persistent vertigo etc\n\nBotox injections to salivary glands\u00a0- both MV &amp; AS\n- Call pedi ultrasound to make sure they\u2019re available and will be in the room at start of case\n- x4 1cc syringes\n- x4 yellow tip 27gauge needles\n- x1 5cc syringe filled with sterile NS. Use 18gauge needle to dilute botox in the 5cc sterile NS.\n- Draw 1cc into each of the 1cc syringes. Place 27gauge needles on the 4 1cc syringes\n- Alcohol swabs to clean skin before injections\n-\u00a0Usually inject 1cc or 20 units/gland\nDr Scott\u2019s OR Guide\nFor Andrew Scott operative note you need to focus on FINDINGS: +/- submucus cleft, Size of Tonsils, Size of Adenoids, Electrocautery Settings.\nAdenotonsillectomy (Scott):\n\nHave shoulder roll and head drape ready\nDrape head, place shoulder roll after intubated and rotated 90 degrees away from anesthesia\nPlace Crowe-Davis mouth gag, feel for submucus cleft palate\nPlace soft suction catheter through nasal cavity; place rolled gauze between soft suction catheter and clamp to secure in place (Vecchiotti does not use rolled gauze)\nStart with adenoidectomy- use microdebrider with the curved blade. Get all the adenoids out before blood hits the suction machine (this is Scott\u2019s gauge if you\u2019re doing it correctly)\nPack with tonsil ball(s)\nRemove tonsils using Bovie electrocautery at setting of 20 and 20. Start more laterally than Vecchiotti (take the anterior pillar) Cauterize the tonsillar fossa with suction electrocautery at setting of 20.\nRemove the tonsil balls, cauterize adenoid bed at setting of 28.\nIrrigate oral and nasal cavity with saline. (The correct way to irrigate the nasal cavity is to place the bulb suction in the nostril, squeeze, and gradually remove will still squeezing so irrigation gets on the patient\u2019s face. Do not release the squeeze while in the nose, as this could cause epistaxis and general annoyance.)\nSuction stomach with adult orogastric tube \u201cTummy time\u201d\nRemove everything, you\u2019re done!\n\nNasal endoscopy case/DCR in combo w/ ophtho - Scott\n- Afrin-soaked pledgets\n- 4.0 zero degree scope (this can be obtained from airway cart, does not need to be sterile, ie. don\u2019t need pedi FESS kit solely for the scope)\n- lido w/\u00a0epi with yellow tip 27gauge needle\n- 4.0 Vicryl TF (if suturing stent in place)\n- BMT kit usually\u00a0adequate for equipment (alligator, Frazier tip suctions), also might need freer - unless planning for full DCR in which case FESS kit +/- drill (not sure which kind) may be necessary\nButterfly tympanoplasty \u2013 Scott\nSteps:\n-inject canal. Make an incision on posterior tragus. Incise through the cartilage to anterior surface. Elevate anterior surface first. Then do posterior. Keep scissors bevel up (check what this means). KEEP the perichondrium on the cartilage\n-just close incision with 2 interrupted sutures to prevent a tragal hematoma\n-rim perforation. Then use cartilage, size it 2mm larger than perforation. Butterfly the cartilage with a #15 blade (circumferentially score it). The perichondrium will cause the edges to curl so it looks like a ear tube. Place it in the perforation."

Dr.\u00a0Rebeiz likes to offer one side at a time\nto see if patients get a response before he does the other\nside.\n\n\n\nCan offer immunotherapy for refractory cases:\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT)\n\n\n\nHigher risk of anaphylaxis\n\n\n\nGive 5-20ug of allergan. Given in physician's office\n\n\n\nMore likely to be covered by insurance\n\n\n\nMore likely to cause SOB, wheezing\n\n\n\nSublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT)\n\n\n\nProbably safer and more effective\n\n\n\n1^st^ dose in office. After that, administered at\nhome\n\n\n\nMore likely to cause GI upset\n**\nAllergy testing:\n\n\n\nSkin testing: contraindicated in eczema, uncontrolled\nasthma, cardiovascular disease or on beta-blockers (Can do blood tests\non these patients instead). Patients should stop antihistamines\n48-72hrs prior\n\n\n\nIntradermal Skin Allergies Testing: Inject 0.01-0.02mL of antigen\ninto dermis with 27G needle to make a 2-3mm wheal. Dilute the extract\n100-1000 times less than the concentration for skin extract. Wheal and\nflare is read in 15-20 minutes. Increase concentration 1:5 until wheal\nenlarges (use 1ml of previous strength + 4ml of dilute)\n\nAllergens (will associated\noral allergy triggers)\nSpring --- trees (birch) \u2192 Apples, Peaches, Carrots,\nPeanuts\nSummer --- grass \u2192 dates, orange, tomato,\nwatermelon\nSummer/Fall --- Mugwort \u2192 celery, carrots\nFall --- Ragweed \u2192 bananas, melon\nNighttime --- dust mites\nCross-reactive oral allergens:\nPeach \u2192 55% of apple, plum, pear\nCantaloupe \u2192 92% avocado, banana, kiwi\nLatex \u2192 30-50% avocado, banana, kiwi\nPediatric Allergens\nMost likely to resolve - Cow's milk &amp; Eggs\nLeast likely to resolve with age - Tree nuts, then peanuts)\n\nOther causes of\nRhinitis\nAcid reflux. MCC of rhinitis. Especially at\nnight.\nRhinoscleroma: nasal deformity 2/2 klebsiella\nRhinosporidososis: strawberry friable nasal mass 2/2\nrhinosporidium seebri\nNonallergic rhinitis w/ eosinophilia Syndrome\n(NARES): associated w/ aspirin allergies.\nRhinitis of pregnancy: avoid afrin. Consider\nturbinate reduction\nAtrophic Rhinitis: Includes empty nose syndrome.\nRhinitis Medicamentosa: due to overuse of afrin\nVasomotor Rhinitis: diagnosis of exclusion.\n\nSinusitis\n-- Clinical Practice Guideline (Italicized = not part of\nguidelines)\nARS: purulent nasal drainage\naccompanied by nasal obstruction, facial\npain-pressure fullness,\nor both. Suspect Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) if\nsymptoms &gt;10days or get better then worse. If you see\npatients w/ symptoms \\12 weeks of symptoms.\nConfirm diagnosis with clinical exam (anterior rhinoscopy, nasal\nendoscopy) or CT sinus. Patients should be evaluated for asthma, cystic\nfibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia +/- allergy\nand immunology testing. Patients should be evaluated for polyps.\nTx: Flonase and/or saline. Some evidence that macrolides or\nbudesonide rinses maybe useful for CRS w/ polyps but not officially\nrecommended. Don't give antifungals.\nIf no response to Flonase, can give course of oral steroids (2-4\nweek) + antibiotics (macrolides especially -- for 3-6 weeks) at same time\n(especially for CRSw/ polyps)\n\nAllergic\nFungal Rhinosinusitis\n\n\n\nMajor Criteria (Bent &amp; Kuhn)\n\n\n\nType 1 hypersensitivity (skin or serology testing)\n\n\n\nNasal poylps\n\n\n\nDouble density sign on CT sinus\n\n\n\nEosinophilic mucus w/o fungal invasion\n\n\n\nPositive fungal stain of sinus content\n\n\n\nMycetoma (Fungal\nBall): typically aspergillus (Y-shaped 45 degree septated\nhyphae) in one sinus treated with surgery\n\n\n\nTx: oral/nasal steroids.

Get\nCT scan, allergy test\nSurgical Tx: Do FESS -- polypectomy, sphenoidethmoidectomy, max\nantrostomy. Send specimen to r/o inverted papilloma\nMedical Tx : aggressive allergy mgmt, flonase +/-\nrhinocort aqua (Budesonide) or Azelastine HCl 137mcg/spray (H1 blocker)\n[2 sprays BID], avoid ASA\nSevere disease: consider low-dose steroids, budesonide\nrinses, corticosteroid eluding stents (propel)\n\nInverted Papilloma\n\n\n\nCaused by HPV 6/11.

Maxillary sinus roof is ur landmark, if\nthe maxillary sinus roof is high, and skull base is low, u may enter\nbasal lamella too high (image 2)\n\n\n\nKeros classification: Distance between fovea ethmoidalis &amp;\ncribriform plate. Type I: 1-3mm; Type 2: 3-7mm; Type 3 (most dangerous)\n7-16mm (Image 2)\n\n\n\nIdentify onodi cells (check coronals) - this is\na posterior ethmoid cell superior or lateral to sphenoid. Important\nbecause the sphenoid isn't posterior to it but the optic nerve/apex is!\n(Image\n\n\n\n\nCheck intrasinus septum of sphenoid (check\naxials) to make sure its doesn't lead to carotid (Image 4)\n\nFrontal Sinusotomy\n\n\n\nCheck sagittal.

No turning, bring bed south\na bit away from anesthesia, mild reverse tberg. Nothing on the eye (no\nointment, no tegaderm). Make sure headpiece screws are tightened.\u00a0Tuck\narms. Throat pack (vag pack). Pack nasal cavity with afrin. Prep with 5%\nbetadine just on nose. Drape with blue towels: 1 over lip and 1 above\nfusion forehead, no towel clamps, split sheet.\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT/FUSION SET-UP: Tower on opposite side, slave tower on\nsurgeon side. Fusion monitor under surgeon monitor. Set up fusion:\nattach forehead sticker and adjust the sticker on fusion screen to\nmatch. Fusion sensing probe 1 fist away from face. Drape fusion with\nlahey bag. Register fusion first before anything! After registered and\nconfirmed, remove probe and register two fusion suctions (curved and\nstraight). Suction should be connected with silastic tubing. Do not open\nmicrodebrider unless rebeiz wants it. If microdebrider is used, ask\nscrub to set it up first (takes time to calibrate) 0 degree 4mm rigid\nhopkins rod, white balance and focus. Fred on patient's right cheek. Wet\nsponge too.\nSURGERY:\n\n\n\nInject 1%\nlido + epi : root of middle turb and lateral nasal wall. Inject with\npatties in place in middle meatus\n\n\n\nRemove packs, use upbiting forceps to medialize middle\nturb.\n\n\n\nTurbinoplasty with up biting tru-cut\nalong inferomedial, inferior, inferolateral surface of middle turb and\nhold medially for 30 secs\n\n\n\nUncinectomy: Use ostium\nseeker to probe max ostium. With cottle,\nperform uncinectomy, then remove inferior portion with a small\nbackbiter. Use ostium seeker to pull\nthe superior uncinate and remove with a upbiting\ntru-bite. Used curved navigation suction to\nconfirm you've opened it up.\n\n\n\nWiden maxillary antrostomy by excising\nthe posterior fontanelle posterior to the maxillary os with a\nstraight tru-bite\n\n\n\nAnterior ethmoidectomy enter ethmoid\nbullae with suction, remove pieces with blakesley\nforcep\n\n\n\nPosterior ethmoidectomy: identify basal\nlamella (horizontal/vertical portion). Enter basal lamella with a\nj curette on inferior/medial aspect below level of the\nroof of the maxillary sinus\n\nFigure 10: Palmer and Chiu, Atlas of Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base\nSurgery.\n\n\n\nSphenoidotomy: anterior face of sphenoid\n= 7cm from nasal sill. Find it medial to superior turbinate or the\nbolger's box method (the box is superior turbinate [medial], lamina\npapyracea [laterally], skull base, basal lamella: locate it\ninferior/medially). Use a straight tru-bite to transect lower 1/3 of\nsuperior turbinate to better visualize sphenoid os, then use j curette\nto enlarge os laterally\n\n\n\nCome back along skull base using J\ncurette\n\n\n\nFrontal sinusotomy: Enter frontal sinus\nwith ostium seeker then curved suction. Take down the\nsuperior part of the uncinate if that hasn't already been done. If there\nis an agger nasi cell, get a 45 or 70 degree scope and\ntake down inferior part of agger nasi. Do not strip\nmucosa. A lot of people just do balloon dilation for frontal\nsinus\n\n\n\nPack and repeat on other side.\u00a0\nClosing:\n\n\n\nSurgiflo in middle meatus. Suction surgiflo, place kennedy pack\nin middle meatus. Irrigate nasal cavity to inflate pack then place\nbactroban around pack in middle meatus. Suction floor of nose to\nnasopharynx.\n\n\n\nBenzoine along nasal tip. Tie kennedy packs and secure to dorsum\nwith steristrips. Remove throat pack.\nPost-op:\u00a0\n\n\n\nKeflex or clinda (if permanent packing in place)\n\n\n\nf/u a week (Tuesday or Thursday)\n\nSONERU FESS SET\nUP / PROCEDURE\n\n\n\nSoneru typically sends pre-operative antibiotics, steroids, and\nnasal saline rinses (NeilMed Sinus Rinse)\n\n\n\nOnce in the OR, intubate patient and tape the tube to the left\nlower lip.\n\n\n\nTurn 90 Degrees counter-clockwise. Video tower should be at the\nleft side of the patient's head across from where you will stand.\nMedtronic Stealth Navigation tower will be place to the right of the\nvideo tower.\n\n\n\nPlace Afrin soaked pledgets in bilateral nasal cavities.\n\n\n\nMicrodebrider, Medtronic navigation instruments, and FESS trays\nare needed for standard FESS\n\n\n\nHave suction electrocautery and nasopores for hemostasis\nBack to homepage"
