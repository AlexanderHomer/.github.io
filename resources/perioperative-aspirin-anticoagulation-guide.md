title: PERIOPERATIVE ASPIRIN/ANTICOAGULATION GUIDE
---
## 
ANTI PLATELET



**Patients with stents:** ASA + P2Y12 (dual) therapy



- 
Bare Metal Stents: must have at least 1 month uninterrupted dual therapy. Recommend 12.

- 
Drug Eluting Stents: must have 6 months of uninterrupted dual therapy

- 
At the very least, keep aspirin on.


#### 
Aspirin



- 
Traditionally thought that need to stop for 1 week since it takes 1 week for new platelets to mature. 50% of platelet function returns in 3 days and 80% in 4 days

- 
Does increase risk of major bleeding and acute kidney injury. No benefit in preventing DVT although some conflicting evidence

- 
Definitely stop aspirin in middle ear surgery, posterior chamber of eye surgery, intracranial surgery, intramedullary spine, and TURP

- 
Should continue patients with bare-metal stents in last 6 weeks or drug eluting stents in last 12 months


#### 
P2Y12 receptor
blockers



Clopidogrel (Plavix) -- stop 5 days preop. Best to consult
cardiologist.



Ticagrelor (brillanta) -- can stop 3 days preop



\*\*if high risk of stent thrombosis, can consider bridging with
GPIIa/IIIb inhibitors


#### 
NSAIDS



Ibuprofen -- stop 24hrs before surgery.



Other NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors: stop 3 days before surgery


## 
ANTICOAGULATION


#### 
Settings where
anticoagulation must be interrupted:



- 
Recent stroke (in past month) or afib not anticoagulated in past month. Delay surgery if possible

- 
Recent DVT being treated with heparin who needs to undergo surgery and cannot get heparin afterwards. Place vena cava filter

- 
Patients with chronically high risk, use a bridging agent



**Wafarin** -- stop 5 days before surgery. Vit K if INR
\>1.5 \[can normally restart 12-24hr postop. Wont be therapeutic for
3days\]. Bridge if recent stroke, heart valve, afib w/ 5-6 CHAD2 with
therapeudic LWMH (1mg/kg BID) 3 days preop (2days after stopping
warfarin)



**DTIs**: Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Rivaroxaban
(Xarelto)/Apixaban (Eliquis) --- stop 2-3days before surgery (2 days if
low risk, 3 days if high risk, 4days if patient has renal failure). No
bridging needs. Restart POD1-2 for low bleeding risk procedures and
POD2-3 for high risk (consider restarting at lower dose like 110mg qday
for 1-2 days). Peak effect only takes 2-3hrs. Can check aPTT \[for
pradaxa\] or Factor Xa \[for xarleto\] to assess if pradaxa is cleared



**When to bridge (typically warfarin patients).**



- 
VTE or arteria embolic event in past 12 weeks. For VTE, post-op bridging better

- 
Mechanical mitral valve, aortic valve, stents

- 
Afib only w/ CHADS2 score 5-6 \[important, BRIDGE trial\]. Bridge pre&post op until therapeutic



**How to bridge**



Choice of therapeutic LWMH \[1mg/kg BID\] or intermediate dose (40mg BID) unless in renal failure then use UFH



- 
STOP bridging LWMH 24hrs before (skip the evening dose the night before surgery) and UFH ggt 4-5hrs preop

- 
RESTART: 24-48hrs if low risk surgery. 48-72hrs if high risk.


#### 
How to Reverse:



- 
warfarin: Vit K, FFP.

- 
heparin use protamine.

- 
dabigatran (pradaxa) use idarucizumab (Praxbind)

Floor Guide Troubleshooting


#### 
Tachycardia



- 

Is the patient hemodynamically stable? Is the rhythm sinus? If
they are not (i.e.Â hypotensive) or it was acute onset, consider atrial
fibrillation or another tachyarrhythmia, get a 12-lead EKG, and call an
upper-level.



- 

What is their baseline?



- 

Are they septic?



- 

Rule out hypovolemia (see "Hypotension").



- 

Is the patient having rebound tachycardia after their home
beta-blockers were stopped? (Beta-block only as a last resort---you should
check with a chief before starting).



- 

Are they in pain? Agitated? Withdrawing? (Alcohol withdrawal can
be fatal).




**

**Voiding** -- if patient hasn't voided 6 hours after
procedure, get bladder scan. If \>400cc, straight cath, if \400cc or spontaneously voiding. If
patient still retaining 6 hours after 1^st^ straight cath,
place foley and start Flomax



**Nutrition****
If you can't get nutrition here is an easy starting TF regiment:



Goal is 25ml/kg/day of standard 1kcal/mL feeds: Jevity 1.0, osmolite
1.0. Start off at 20mL/hr increase by 20mL/hr q8hrs until goal of
80mL/hr for x hours. (x is 0.3\*weight kg)



if patient is obese, x maybe greater than 24. In this case, give
concentrated feeds: Jevity 1.5 (this has 1.5kCal/mL so give 16mL/kg/day)
Start off at 20mL/hr increase by 20mL/hr q8hrs until goal of 80mL/hr for
x hours. (x is 0.2\*weight kg)



For Bolus:



For Jevity 1.0 - give 0.1cans/kg/day. Split up QID



Jevity 1.5 - give 0.067cans/kg/day. Split up QID



For free water flushes: 7mL/kg/day split up either BID, TID, QID



#### 
Electrolytes



**Hypokalemia** (Keep level \>2 for trauma/arrhythmia
patients)



- 

Give at IV K+ 20mEq/hr centrally, 10mEq/hr peripherally, or at
your discretion



- 

Orally 10mEq of KCl raises potassium 0.1mEq/L. Address
hypomagnesemia simultaneously.





**Hyperkalemia**



- 

Between 5-6:



- 

Get an EKG and look for peaked T-waves, widened QRS, or flattened
P-waves



- 

Give furosemide or polystyrene 30g PO/PR x1, recheck after bowel
movement



- 

Stop potassium in fluids. Consider stopping potassium-sparing
diuretics.





- 

\>6 or symptomatic:



- 

Get a STAT EKG and look for peaked T-waves, widened QRS, or
flattened P-waves



- 

Put the patient on telemetry



- 

Regular insulin 10units IV/subQ (shunts K+ into cells)



- 

D50 1amp IV/IM/subQ (prevents hypoglycemia)



- 

Calcium gluconate 2g IV (stabilizes cardiac membrane)



- 

Stop potassium in fluids and potassium-sparing

- 

Optional: Sodium bicarbonate 1mEq/kg slow IVP (max 100mEq,
alkalinizes blood)



- 

Optional: Albuterol neb 5mg inh (increases insulin
level)



- 

Optional: Furosemide 10-40mg IV / double their daily dose (onset
\~1h)





**Hypocalcemia**




1.  Check ionized calcium or correct ((total calcium) +
    (0.8)(4.5-serum albumin))
    

    
    - 
    
    Very low (Ca^2+^ \1yo 0.25mcg daily



**Hypercalcemia**




1.  NS 500mL-1000mL IV bolus (beware of hypervolemia, do not give in
    renal failure)
    

    

    2.  Furosemide 20-40mg IV / double their daily dose (also prevents
        volume overload)
        

        

        3.  Hold thiazide diuretics

            trauma/arrhythmia patients)
            

            

            1.  If \<1.2, magnesium sulfate 4g IV
                

                

                2.  Otherwise, magnesium sulfate 2g IV or magnesium oxide 400-800mg PO
                    daily
                    

                    
                    **Hypermagnesemia**
                    

                    

                    2.  Furosemide 20-40mg IV / double daily dose
                        

                        

                        3.  Calcium gluconate 2g IV (stabilizes cardiac membrane)
                            

                            
                            **Hypophosphatemia** (not usually treated in
                            non-transplant, non-NPO floor patients)
                            

                            

                            1.  Sodium phosphate 250-500mg PO / 8-16mmol IV
                                

                                

                                2.  Potassium phosphate 8-16mmol IV (approx 4.4mEq/mL of
                                    potassium)
