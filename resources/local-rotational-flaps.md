title: Local Rotational Flaps
---
Local rotational flaps allow closure of facial defects with tissue that matches color and contour. Examples include:



- 
**Ear** -- concave helical rim defects repaired with a posterior auricular interpolation flap.

- 
**Lip** -- lateral lip defects may be closed with a rotation flap from adjacent tissue; avoid medial cheek recruitment to preserve the melolabial crease.

- 
**Nose**

- 
Anterior alar groove: island pedicle flap.

- 
Nasal tip or dorsum/sidewall: bilobed flap for 1--1.5Â cm defects.



    



For complex reconstruction, consult a facial plastics reference for flap design and planning.
