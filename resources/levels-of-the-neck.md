title: Levels of the Neck
---
The neck is divided into lymph node levels that help describe disease extent and guide neck dissection.



- 
**Level I** -- submental and submandibular nodes bordered by the digastric muscles and mandible.

- 
**Level II** -- upper jugular nodes from the skull base to the hyoid bone, anterior to the sternocleidomastoid.

- 
**Level III** -- middle jugular nodes between the hyoid and cricoid cartilage.

- 
**Level IV** -- lower jugular nodes from the cricoid cartilage to the clavicle.

- 
**Level V** -- nodes of the posterior triangle along the spinal accessory nerve.

- 
**Level VI** -- anterior compartment nodes surrounding the larynx and trachea.



Understanding these levels is essential for staging head and neck cancers.
